I had one burst after awhile, you could see it buldge for weeks before it went so no suprises. The other one was winter related as I am bad and leave them out most of the time. Highly reccomend. Note the hundred footer is heavy and like wresting an anaconda when its time to put away, but it does have a far reach.',\n",
       " 'Gilmour 10-58050 8-ply Flexogen Hose 5/8-Inch by 50-Foot, Green This is a high quality 8 ply hose. I have had good luck with Gilmour hoses in the past. A good choice in hoses.',\n",
       " \"Very satisfied! It's probably one of the best hoses I've ever had.Pro's:- It's good enough for most front yards, or small back yards.- It has enough flow (and with the right head) to water plants 25ft away from the nozzle, and water your garden.- It's light weight, and flexible (it does not pose as much of a problem unrolling this hose with kinks as with other hoses I've owned)- The hose is flexible, yet strong. I haven't cut the outside yet.- This hose has been in full sunlight for more than 3 months, and the rubber hasn't cracked yet! I believe it's good quality rubber.cons:- Like with every hose, keeping it outside in the sunshine, the water warms up and starts smelling.My dog don't want to drink from the water coming from this hose.- The hose is only in one color (I wished it was a little less visible in the gardenOtherwise this hose is an excellent garden tool!I bought 2 of them, one 25ft for my front garden, and 50ft for my rear garden.3-4months and still in excellent condition!\",\n",
       " \"Very high quality I probably should have bought something a bit more flexible and less rugged since I constantly coil/uncoil it for washing cars, but that's my fault not a product fault.\",\n",
       " \"Good Hoses I bought three of these 5/8-inch Flexogen hoses--50, 75, and 100 feet--for different areas of yard around the house.  After a season of use they've proven to be good hoses.  Of course, it's very favorable that they don't leak.  But what particularly impresses me about them is their notably light weight and flexibility, which make them a lot easier to handle than my previous hoses.  The flexibility diminishes in cold weather, but a garden hose is less useful then anyway.They're not especially prone to kinking, but they're not kink-proof, either, nor do they claim to be.  They kink a lot less than one of my old hoses and more than a couple of others, but the latter were fairly stiff, so there was a trade-off.Bottom line:  this was a good purchase.\",\n",
       " 'GGGGGGGGREAT I aqm impressed with the cost and quality of this product, Also impressed on the fast shipment by Amazon as I received it in 4 days, Has not kinked and a great hose as I had one before which I left in the yard during all seasons and even ran across driveway, But it lasted 5 good years through all the abuse,  I would recommend this to anyone, Thanks',\n",
       " 'More powerful water flow After using this hose I will never go back to small diameter garden hoses.  The water flows with much more force, which is especially useful when using the jet nozzle.  Most garden hoses are only 1/2\" diameter, and some premium hoses are 5/8\", but this is 3/4\".There is a significant water pressure loss with regular hoses because the smaller diameter means that more of the water is in contact with the walls, plus it flows at higher velocity further increasing the friction.  You\\'d be amazed looking at the charts, just how much pressure is lost with the cheap standard hoses.  For example:I\\'m looking at a plastic pipe friction head loss chart.  At 5 gallons per minute, the pressure friction head loss per 100 ft is 5.3 ft for a 3/4\" pipe (same size as this hose).  For a 1/2\" (regular hose size) pipe the head loss is 20.7 ft - that\\'s 4x less height that the water can travel merely because of friction from the smaller inside diameter!I also noticed, this hose also has less tendency to kink.',\n",
       " \"WOW This Is Tough This is one tough hose and it is thick and stiff.The connections are strong and the hose is industrial strength.I bought this to use with my pressure washer because it is 8 ply and 3/4 inch wide.My old hose was just rubber and it was flexing and twisting and there is no way this hose is going to do that.The hose is warrantied for life and unless there is a problem with a leak i don't think i will ever need to use it.The local big box stores do not sell a 3/4 50 foot hose and my pressure washer will not operate with anything longer than 50 feet.The price and delivery were great and Amazon is the best around if there is ever a concern.\",\n",

       " \"Just as hoped I was worried about getting a short one, but this serves my need just fine, as it accompanied by a longer and more troublesome one.  I leave the sprinkler on it instead of switching heads - so much easier.  slightly stiff to lay out, but if it weren't, I am sure it would kink.

       " \"Great Hose...Decent Price I've always been one of those people that bought the cheapest kind of hose whenever I needed one.  I don't do much in the way of gardening, nor wash my car that often.  So investing in a really good quality hose didn't make that sense to me.  The only flaw in that logic is cheap hoses have a habit of breaking and leaking just sitting there on the reel, whether you use them or not.  So in the long run you don't save much.  That, and the fact that cheap hoses also make you feel like you are wrestling a snake when using them for they are so stiff and kink like crazy.  When I decided to buy a better hose I came across this one and liked it immediately.  It's very well made and just about as flexible a hose you can buy without going for one of those new fangled shrinking hoses.  (I'm not sold on the long term quality of those).  This thing is a pleasure to use, as well as making it much simpler a task of rolling it up when you're done.  It kinda reminds me of what my cheap hose felt like when it was sitting out stretched in the sun for a while.  It would feel much softer and more flexible.  Something this does with or without sun.  Though its true that getting that flexibility carries with it a little more weight in the hose itself, its such a pleasure to use that I feel the trade off is well worth it.  It only takes a short time to get used to it being a little heavier anyway, and I love being able to roll it up on the reel when done so easily.  A top notch hose that carries a generous amount of quality, convenience, all for a fair price that I highly recommend... : )\",\n",
       " 'Landscaper Approved! I\\'ve been in the Landscape Industry for over 60 years and have owned my own company for 23 years. One of the odder phenomenons I\\'ve experienced is that client\\'s will spend $1,000 on a garden sculpture or $100 for a bottle of wine for a garden party but then they turn into Scrooge McDuck when it comes to sinking ANY SUM OF MONEY into the items required to properly care for the garden!Gimmicks abound in any industry but it seems that in the Green Industry, a Fool and Their Money is Guaranteed to Be Parted! Curly hoses, shrinky hoses, pink & purple hoses...the very item that delivers Life Giving Water is dismissed and ignored and people insist on spending the LEAST amount of money on a hose. Aside from the very important matter of a hose needing double walls to withstand the constant P.S.I. (pounds per square inch), a good hose also needs to have solid brass couplings, and have enough plys to avoid kinking.THIS hose delivers! Yes, there is heft to it\\'s weight...that\\'s what you NEED from a quality hose! And, it refuses to kink, even when you try to kink it as a test. I\\'ve bought Gilmour hoses for clients and my own company\\'s use for over 17 years and NEVER needed to replace a single one! The 25 foot length is excellent to extend a longer hose for occasional use, rather than dragging that extra length around your property 24/7. Also, for very small Urban Gardens, rarely do you need more than 15 feet of hose so the 25\\' length is perfect for city gardens or roof top decks.Here are some tips from someone that works for a living with garden hoses:1) Use a cheap rope that you pick up at the Dollar Store to get the MAXIMUM LENGTH of hose you need. Mark that length down. Then, using the same rope, measure the NORMAL LENGTH that you will need on a daily/weekly basis. If the difference is more than 10 feet, BUY TWO OR MORE HOSES! Yes, I know that sounds insane but hear me out.If on a daily basis, you only need a 50\\' hose to reach your 40\\' garden, WHY are you buying a 100\\' hose to drag around? If you only need that additional 25 or 50 feet for the few times you wash your car or windows or fill a pool, buy some quick-connects and the extention hose length that you\\'ll only use rarely. Hoses come in 10\\', 25\\', 50\\', 75\\', 100\\' and 150\\' length; ONLY buy the shortest length you need 90% of the time and then an additional hose to attach when needed.2) To coil your hose easily whether you store it on the ground or on a hose wheel, turn OFF THE WATER and keep the nozzle OPEN to drain the pounds and pounds of water that are trapped inside the hose! If you hate getting dirty hands, use garden gloves to coil it up and using the natural curl of the hose, just continue to coil it, turning the hose as needed.3) During the Summer, attach a PLASTIC SHUT OFF VALVE to both ends of the hose: the one connected to your home\\'s spigot and also to the nozzle of choice. WHY? Because plastic does NOT corrode like any metal will do and if you have high minerals in your water, there are times that the hose coupling will actually become permanently corroded to the spigot or nozzle, making it completely impossible to remove! I know that we\\'re taught that Metal=Good and Plastic=Bad but trust me...when I have to tell a client that they either need to replace a $70 hose or hire a plumber to remove a sealed/corroded coupling, that $2 dollar plastic gate valve becomes priceless!4) ALWAYS DRAIN YOUR HOSE, DETACH THE GATE VALVES AND STORE YOUR HOSE, VALVES AND NOZZLE IN A FREEZE-PROOF AREA!!! If I don\\'t do it for my client\\'s and trust them to do it, it never gets done. And after the first hard frost, trapped water in nozzles, hoses and valves expands and can destroy all of the above in one night. It takes less than 30 minutes to winterize two hoses and attachments; figure out the cost of replacing everything in Spring when you find them all destroyed!5) One of the best ways to RUIN ANY HOSE, is to tug-tug-tug at the coupling, which breaks the weld and suddenly you have a leak that can\\'t be fixed! I simply make a small loop in the end that attachs to the house which acts as a \"brake\" and takes the pressure off of the coupling and spigot.I only recommend landscape items that I trust to use with all my employees and on all my jobs. When I gain new clients, I teach them the benefits of a good hose and order it for them, never having to do it again. Buy one less bottle of good wine and use that cash for your hose. You won\\'t be sorry! :)',\n",
       " 'Gilmour 8-ply Flexogen Hose 25 Foot This little hose was purchased to add on to my other 50 foot hose due to the very humid and oppressive weather this last month in the Northeast.

       " 'standard product There is only one thing wrong with this design:  the spray shape and the water volume can not be controlled independently. Better designs have one control for open-closed and another for spray shape. That makes this nozzle useless for filling buckets and other close applications. It is impossible to get high volume at low pressure output.That said, the simple design is almost bomb-proof and the price is fair.',\n",
       " 'pistol grip This is definitely a good quality nozzle. It is similar to the &#34;old fashioned&#34; type nozzle we had as kids. It gives differing spray patterns depending on how far you squeeze the trigger.',\n",
       " \"Never thought it was possible to love a hose nozzle! It looks like it came right out of an episode of Leave It To Beaver but don't be fooled by this retro-looking nozzle. This feels great in my hand and functions way better than the plethora of nozzles I have tried in the past. The trigger has a real nice, snappy, feel to it.Unlike my other nozzles that are made from plastic, I actually think this will survive a winter outdoors in PA. The only thing I have to get used to is that the type of spray is determined by the pressure I apply on the trigger. Everything else about it is perfect.\",\n",
       " 'Gilmour Full Size Zinc Pistol Grip Nozzle I am very happy that I bought this nozzle. It is exactly what I wanted. Good quality and I highly recommend it. I really need it too.',\n",
       " 'Nozzle I have bought many types of nozzle over the years and this old timer which I used to use when I was growing up served me well this past season.',\n",
       " \"Simple... sturdy... inexpensive... This is a nice hose nozzle - simple design, sturdily made and inexpensive. It can go from high-powered jet mode to gently spray just by loosening your grip. It also doesn't leak at all where it attaches to the hose!My only gripe would be that when you use the widest spray pattern, it can come out unevenly &#8211;e.g., it's not an even &#34;circle&#34; of water coming out, which makes watering evenly a little challenging. But it's not a big deal.Get one, you'll like it.\",\n",
       " 'Does the Job Nozzles exactly like this have been around for at least 40 years--manufactured in a dozen companies--and sold under a wide variety of brand names---for a very good reason---they are the best design.  They are perfectly and easily controllable, durable, and don\\'t leak.  You can get \"prettier\" versions with plastic covers over the grip and plastic handles, if \"pretty\" is your priority---but, functionally speaking, you can\\'t buy a better designed garden hose nozzle.THUMB SCREWNote the little thumb screw at the end of the piston can be used to adjust the type of spray when the handle is maximally squeezed.  If you wish, you can tighten the screw (you may need pliers to do so, and/or you may need to grease the screw threads) back from full unfocused flow to the tightest stream for long throws---that makes long throws a little easier.LOCK-ON LOOPNotice the small wire loop at top---when the lever is complete depressed, you can rotate the loop back to prevent the lever from closing, and then you can release your grip.  So, this is a \"lock on\" device, which becomes particularly useful when you use the brass screw to adjust to the pattern you want.  For example, if you always want a medium cone spray, you can adjust the sprayer semi-permanently to that setting.NOT A VALVEOne reviewer complains that there is no \"medium\" strength, e.g., for filling buckets.  What do you expect?  The actual \"problem\", as far as that reviewer was concerned, is the nozzle is \"too good\"---it delivers full pressure, at all but the tightest mist setting.  Although it does have a \"closed\" position, this is a nozzle, NOT a valve. If you want a VALVE to reduce the PRESSURE, then install aMelnor 390S Hose Shut-Offor aGilmour Brass Garden Hose Connector With Shut-Off Valve 03Vjust before the nozzle.  Or, close your faucet part way.  Alternatively, to fill a bucket, loosen the thumb screw, then \"open \\'er up\" (squeeze the handle all the way)---the result is is maximum unfocused flow, which is perfect for very quickly filling a bucket, etc.COMPLAINTS OF OTHER REVIEWERSMany reviewers (of this and other products) write reviews about different, but similar-looking, products.  Many of the complaints are about sprayers which are NOT \"Gilmour 572TF\".  If you find a sprayer that looks like this in \"bargain bin\" at your local hardware store---it probably is not a \"Gilmour 572TF\", unless the packaging says so.  Sometimes when you order from an Amazon Vendor (rather than Amazon itself)---you don\\'t get exactly the product described.  I\\'m NOT saying that Gilmour is always the best, but only that THIS review is about the \"Gilmour 572TF\", and other reviewers 1-star reviews MAY not be.CAVEATSHere in the tropics (South Florida)---the year-round heat is hard on all garden tools.  After a year or two, the zinc metal body can seize on your hose and be difficult to unscrew.  I suggest greasing the screw threads with silicon grease when you install it on the hosePermatex 22058 Dielectric Tune-up Grease - 3 oz.If you don\\'t have silicon grease on hand, buy a tube---it terrific for improving electrical connections and refurbishing rubber items, and even for lubricating things such as this.  While you are at it, lubricate all your hose connections (both the threads and the seals) to prevent leaking and to make it easy to screw-on and -off the hoses and accessories.Why not petroleum-based grease?  Petroleum-based grease damages rubber seals.  However even petroleum grease is better than no grease (besides most hose gaskets are now plastic, not rubber)After 2 or 3 years of abuse the action can get begin to get stiff, presumably caused by internal corrosion (or the original grease having deteriorated or lost).  The handle (the lever in back) is steel, and can rust.  Ultimately the stiffness plus the rust results in the handle breaking (after 5 years or so of abuse).  Ideally, keep the nozzle dry---at least don\\'t keep it in a muddy puddle, or half-buried in acidic soil.  It is good idea to lubricate the piston with grease when you start to notice it getting stiff. (With the water off, squeeze the handle to expose the brass rod.  Apply a liberal amount of grease to the piston).  If the nozzle is very stiff, take it off the hose, spray it heavily with WD-40, let it soak for 15 minutes or so---that will probably adequately loosen it up, but is not a permanent solution---you still need to grease it.But those are the extremes---reasonably well taken care of (or at least not abused) a nozzle can last 10 years or more.ALTERNATIVES> Folks with arthritis or weak grips may be happier with traditional brass nozzles, such asDramm 12380 Heavy-Duty Brass Adjustable Hose Nozzle.  These are virtually indestructible, and hold any particular spray pattern until you change it.> Those \"prettier\" versions of the zinc nozzle with plastic handles I mentioned may be more pleasant to use in the winter, and might get the wife\\'s approval.  Often these are only 50 cents or so more than the 573TF, and in that case are clearly better choices.Gilmour 572TFR Commercial Insulated Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front, Red,Gilmour Comfort Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front 593 Black,Gilmour 572 Insulated Pistol Grip Nozzle.> High quality all plastic versions are available for use around salt water.Gilmour Salt Water and Marine Nozzle 474S> There are cheap plastic versions you can get for $1--$2 in \"bargain bins\", which are a good deal for the price, but are not nearly as durable, and through an Amazon vendor when you add shipping your total cost is the same as a zinc or high quality plastic sprayer.> There are versions with spray-pattern or nozzle heads on the front---but that sabotages the virtues of the basic design, reducing the sprayer body into a mere valve.  You\\'d be better off with a brass nozzle sprayer mentioned above.  I find constantly having to rotate the head to select the 1 or 2 spray patterns I use to be very annoying.  For example (not recommended)Gilmour Pistol Grip Nozzle 327 Teal/Red> If you (or your wife) insists on a \"pretty\" nozzle with s electable spray patterns, I suggest the hybridGilmour Select-A-Spray Comfort Grip Nozzle 594 Black/Tealor Gilmour Select-A-Spray Metal Nozzle 584.  One setting is the full-action, and there are several selectable patterns.NERD CORNERThe zinc body corrodes through electrolytic action.  I.e., the zinc will \"sacrifice\" itself (and corrode) to protect iron or any other metal of lower electrolytic potential which it is touching, or with which it is sharing a conducting solution (such as a water-saturated acidic soil), or salt-water .  So try to keep it dry and away from unpainted, ungalvanized steel, or salt water.  (Galvanized steel is iron coated with zinc for this very purpose, to prevent the iron from rusting--not as a barrier like paint, but rather by electrolytic action).What about those other pretty, fancy, mostly plastic sprayer nozzles (which cost 3x--4x more) that you see at the garden center?---they don\\'t work nearly as well, and won\\'t last nearly as long.  I know this for a fact---my wife keeps buying them---indeed we have a bin of discarded (mostly still functional) \"pretty\" sprayer nozzles, which have \"fallen out of favor\" for various reasons.',\n",

       " \"A Cinch To Operate I've always bought cheap sprinklers that would ineffectively water the lawn and me, too. It killed me to spend so much on a sprinkler, but I've probably sunk so much on junk sprinklers in the past 10 years and bit the bullet after reading the reviews for the Raintrain. Convenience alone makes this sprinkler really attractive, but it does a good job and that is a real draw.Operation is easy. Extend the garden hose where you want to water as the hose is the 'track' that the Raintrain runs on. By adjusting the time and the pressure you essentially control where you water and the degree of water used. Then sit back and enjoy as  the Raintree does the work.  No more moving the sprinkler or possibly getting showered. It doesn't get much simpler.The spray is low and slow so everything gets watered more effectively and there is less evaporation. My lawn really looks better than it had when I used my old sprinkler.I use this in my garden  and it does a good job keeping all my perennials and herbs staying healthy and lush.This sprinkler is well made and worth the higher than average price.\",\n",
       " \"Sturdily built There are some positive features about the Nelson Raintree Traveling Sprinkler that makes is an excellent sprinkler, and a good one to have if one has a large lawn. It's definitely sturdily built, and with a steel body, it appears nearly indestructible. Because it's a &#34;traveling&#34; sprinkler, once you have it set and have placed the hose in the middle of the track you want it to cover, it will move on its own and give a wide area of lawn a thorough sprinkling. One doesn't have to run out every little while to move the sprinkler so that it can water another patch of ground. Also, there's a little ramp you can run the hose through so that when the sprinkler has completed its intended course it reaches the ramp and shuts off on its own. This is particularly useful if you're not going to be around to monitor it.Now, a couple less positive features. First, this is an appropriate sprinkler only for those parts of the lawn that are relatively wide open and devoid of obstacles. We have a number of large trees in both our front and back yards. Also, we have tree rings and the like, which mean that parts of our lawn are isolated from the rest. We need a second sprinkler to cover these parts. So, buy this only if you have a large enough amount of open space to make having one worthwhile.Second, it is a very heavy sprinkler. I realize that this is the price one pays for a large metal object. But if you want a light-weight piece of equipment, this isn't it.\",\n",
       " 'Fun and functional, but a lot of work I\\'ve had my Raintrain for a little over a year now.  I was initially very enthusiastic about it, but over time, I grew less satisfied with it.Pros:>For some reason, it\\'s mesmerizing to watch.  After I get it set up, I always watch for a few moments to make sure the water throw is adjusted properly, and then I find myself watching it longer than necessary.  There\\'s just something cool and relaxing about how the arms spin and the wheels turn and how it slowly moves along.  From talking to some other people who own this and similar products, \"sprinkler watching\" seems to be a common phenomenon.>The coarse spray is ideal for use in windy areas.  You\\'ll get a lot less drift and evaporation using this than you would with a finer-droplet sprinkler.>The adjustability is impressive.  I have a long, 4-foot swatch of grass that would be difficult to water with most other sprinklers, but on the Raintrain, I can point the arms way down and keep the water where I want it.  But I can also point the arms way up and throw the water for at least 50 feet.>It\\'s quiet.  The only sound it makes is the water hitting the grass.>The shut-off feature is very handy and worked quite well (initially).>It stands up well to neglect.  I left both my sprinkler and the stop block sitting outside in the sun and snow all winter, and come spring, they seemed no worse for wear.  Also, you are supposed to disconnect the sprinkler and let it drain after each use, and I\\'ve never done that, with no apparent effect yet.Cons:>This thing is really heavy, as it needs to be, but when you\\'re hauling it out to the north forty (okay, the back of a 6500-square-foot lawn), it\\'s a little cumbersome.>The hose connection is awkwardly placed.  It\\'s in the somewhat narrow space at the back between the wheels, so I find it a little difficult to get a good grip on the connector.  There are also two inexplicable protrusions in the body of the sprinkler right next to the connector, and this makes it even harder to grip.  This is why I never drain my sprinkler like I\\'m supposed to; I hate connecting it.>The connector always leaks, even after I put in a gasket, and the hose sometimes loosens while it\\'s traveling.>Getting the water to throw just the right distance is a pain.  You have to turn on the water, see where it\\'s throwing, turn it off, walk out to the sprinkler, adjust the arms, walk back to the faucet, turn it on, see if that\\'s right, and then repeat until you have it where you want it, which might involve several tries.>The water is thrown in a circle, but only to the outside of the circle.  This is easily seen if you have the sprinkler set where it will be thrown on concrete.  You can see the arc of the circle and the dry area inside it.  The way the Raintrain gets all the ground covered is by advancing this outline through the yard.  For this reason, the stationary setting on the sprinkler is useless.  It will water the outline of the circle only.>Because of the circle outline problem, the area at the beginning and end of the course will get half as much water as the rest of the yard (the beginning of the course will only be hit by the trailing edge of the circle, and the end of the course will only be hit by the front edge).  To compensate for this, I turn off the water, pick up the Raintrain, and move it back at both the beginning and end so that the areas get covered by the half circle twice.  This creates a lot of extra work for what I was hoping would be a labor-saver.>I found that the Raintrain doesn\\'t deliver nearly as much water as it says it will.  The farther you throw the water, the less depth of water you\\'ll put out (because the same amount of water is being spread out over a bigger area), but when I had the arms adjusted for a pretty narrow path, I only measured about a quarter inch of water (even on \"low gear,\" which makes it travel more slowly).  This likely explains why I\\'ve struggled so much with keeping my lawn green since I got the Raintrain.  With stationary sprinklers, you can leave them running as long as necessary to achieve the water delivery you need.  But with the Raintrain, if you need more water than it delivers, your only option is to lay out the hose again and start it over, which is a lot of extra work.>While the sprinkler seems overall pretty solid and durable, I knocked a big chip of paint off the \"nose\" when I set it up on end to attach the hose, and the bare spot rusted immediately.>Laying out the hose for a straight line is simple, but if you want to do any curves, it takes a lot of practice and trial and error to create a path that won\\'t make the Raintrain \"jump the track.\"  The tightness of curve it can handle depends on several factors, such as the height and density of the grass, the softness of the ground, and any small bits of yard debris the wheels might go over.>The stop valve on the underside (which is triggered by the stop block) stopped working on mine during its second season.  Now when it runs over the stop block, it slows down, and the arms start turning more slowly, but it doesn\\'t actually stop.  This greatly reduced the handiness of the Raintrain for me.Overall, this is a fun sprinkler, and it has its uses, but I\\'ve decided to try something else this summer.  The Raintrain is just too cumbersome and time-consuming to set up for my particular needs.',\n",
       " \"Works as advertised This looks like it will be a great piece of equipment.  I've used it a couple of times so far and have been impressed.  The only problem is if it hits a soft area of the yard, the wheels can sink in and it gets stuck.  You certainly can't just set it and forget it.  It needs to be babysat every half hour or so to ensure it is still moving.\",\n",
       " \"Close but no Cigar This sprinkler seemed to be a perfect fit for what I needed but unfortunately I had to return it.I have about 4500 square feet of grass including backyard and my yard is someone weird shaped, so I figured this sprinkler would work well for me.My first complain is its very slow so I am unable to track how much water this is really consuming. I am a college student and stay at home dad, I don't have the money for a high water bill.Second complain is that's it a heavy piece of metal and I don't understand why it needs to be so heavy. I don't mind lifting weights but I don't wanna lift while I'm working in my grass, this is an expensive sprinkler and I'm not leaving it outside at night so carrying this inside every night is somewhat of a hassle.Pros- I like the coverage it gets, it covers a lot of space and it left me having to only use it a few feet of hose.Setup was pretty simple, I can recall a few times adjusting the sprayers and running off getting my pants soaked lolOverall I give it a B- I think you should just stick with your regular sprinkler, save yourself the hassle and skip this purchase\",\n",
       " \"Disappointing I remember my dad using a sprinkler like this when I was a kid (I'm 61).  We are in the middle of a drought here in Texas and I was tired of having to move the sprinkler and thought this would solve my problem.  First of all, this is a VERY heavy sprinkler and is awkward to pick up and move.  If you have any trouble lifting heavy objects, get something else.  It has to be moved.  You can't drag it and you can't turn it around and make it go the other direction.  I have found I have to check on it as often, if not more often, than I was moving my oscillating sprinkler.  First, it jumped off the hose/track and was climbing the fence.  Then, it kinked the hose and cut off the water.  Finally, it dug itself a hole and had mud all over the back wheels.  Tried it another time and it just stopped spraying water.  No kink this time, checked the button on the bottom, couldn't get it going again.  I went back to my oscillating sprinkler.  At least it's easy to move around.  I think you need to use this on a very flat, very straight lawn.  Mine is bumpy and I need it to make a couple of gentle curves.  It didn't work for me.  I like the spray it puts out and would use it as a stationery sprinkler if it weren't so heavy to move.\",\n",
       " 'Flexible and effective way to water your lawn After hearing so much about this unit, and seeing a couple of them in my neighborhood, I decided to give it a try, even though the price was higher than I ever expected to pay for a lawn sprinkler.I now know why so many  people like it.  It is very effective in watering the lawn, without  spraying water high up in the air (less chance for evaporation, and not  affected by wind as much), and it has hands-off operation once you set it  up.Adjusting the spray diameter is easy, and using the hose as a way to  set the travel path for the sprinkler to follow is a great idea.  The  adjustable speed allows you to decide how much water to apply and how much  ground you want to cover in a period of time.Inspecting the yard  afterwards shows that the ground is nicely saturated, and not needing to go  out and move hoses is a welcomed change. This sprinkler is worth the  purchase price!',\n",
       " \"Works great but will it last Update/Tip: The way our yard is this shoots too large of a swath so I went to Lowes and got a 3 foot piece of 1/2 inch aluminum pipe and made some new arms. I can now get as small as about 2 1/2 feet to around 40 feet. What's cool is that they can be adjusted or I can use combination of any of the arms. For instance, I will use one of the original with one of my new ones. The new one will get the center which the originals don't do that well. I drilled 1/16 inch holes which are plenty large enough. See my photos for a better idea.----------------------------------------------------------Unfortunately it's a little early for us to be watering here in the NW. In fact, we don't always need to water except we set a record last year for something like 80 days straight with no rain. But even in July and August the rain is limited so to keep things green and the garden growing we need to water. Sprinkler systems being too expensive for how often we use them sprinklers like this can be a time saver if they work.I tried it out and it did work. I found I could get down to about a 5 foot width by turning the heads down. But you are limited how far to turn them down or they will hit the tractor.The sprinkler heads need to point a certain direction or it will go backwards...I thought high speed was perfect for my needs. Fast enough I watched it travel 5 feet for my test and it shut off as expected.It does look cool and is fun to watch!Over having to move a sprinkler this really is awesome and compared to a sprinkler system the cost is great. I didn't open it up but if it does indeed have plastic gears how long will it last? As often as I will need it here it may last me a long time. Hopefully a decent investment.\",\n",
       " 'I love my Rain Train! I own a yard where either the person who planted the trees or the one who ran the irrigation pipes needed a few more lessons about what happens ten years later when that 6\\' tree becomes a 25 footer and the roots are wrapped around the pipe that was laid 12\" away from it.Because of a variety of issues from shallow topsoil with an uneven granite underlay to existing water/sewer/power lines to heavy tree and root growth, new pipes just aren\\'t in the cards.  Every year I turn on the sprinkler system and start fixing busted pipes and sprinkler heads that have been pushed off by a root.  I\\'ve been very lucky so far, I\\'ve been able to repair all but one of them.  Once I found myself up to my armpit in a hole not much bigger than my arm, through dense roots where I managed to glue a new pipe piece in.Clearly this sort of stuff takes a lot of time to fix sometimes, and in the meanwhile hand watering my half acre in 100 degree, 0% humidity summers is just a no-go.Enter the Rain Train, because its time to make it rain! :)You lay out a hose path for this, no sharp turns, and only on grass not on pavement or any other type of surface as this may destroy the gears in the unit.  Place the little yellow plastic ramp over the hose where you want it to stop, and insert the metal rod in the ground to hold it.  Turn on the water and set to high or low (high goes faster, disperses less water per square inch) and go do something else for a while.  You can adjust the two spray wands to an angle that gives you the desired coverage, then use the faucet to fine tune it.I have a very hilly yard and after hefting this I was concerned it wouldn\\'t make it uphill, but it appears to move at the same speed regardless of the terrain.  On high you have to stare hard at the wheel spokes for a bit before you can detect movement.  How this works is water comes from the hose into the rear of the unit, then through the two wands which spin, turning a gear that turns the wheels.  Simple and ingenious.I\\'ve only had it jump off the hose once, and thats when I made a real hairpin turn to see if it could make it.  Do note that if it jumps the hose it\\'ll go off in some semi-random arc until it runs out of hose.  So while its tempting to set it and go to bed or leave for the day, you might want to check on it once in a while.This is also very handy for those really dry areas where I want to apply a lot of water to a decent sized spot but I dont want to have to remember to keep moving a sprinkler and to turn it off.  This is a nice time and water saver.For those times when I lose a pipe, its also nice to know I have a week or so to fix it and can get the coverage I need from the Rain Train.  This wont ever replace a full sprinkler system, but it\\'d be fine for watering a really large area that hasn\\'t been fitted with an irrigation system yet, or as I use it for large spot overwatering and temporary irrigation replacement.',\n",
       " \"hmmm, not the best hose in the world It's hard writing a review for this Flexogen garden hose because it has a couple big problems, but something else about it makes up for that one problem. Read on:One thing you have to know- pretty much ANY garden hose you buy will tangle if you don't wrap it the right way. However, some hoses it won't matter if you don't do a good job wrapping it. Unfortunately, others (like this one) are sort of cheap and get knotted easily, so you DO have to take the time to wrap it correctly or else the hose will be damaged over time. I guess if you're not the type of person that wraps the hose when you're done with it (and just leave it sit in the yard) none of this will matter. But in my house we have to wrap the hoses.This means, if you drag the hose across the yard, you might have to go back and straighten out the knots because knots WILL most likely happen. And they will happen in three or four different spots on the hose. To me that's a sign of a bad hose. If one knot occurs that's ok. More than one knot and the hose is bad.However, the one thing that makes up for the knot problem is that I've NEVER had a problem with this hose squirting water where it shouldn't. You see, it's hard for me to say whether this Flexogen hose is bad or good. It has problems, but if you can deal with the knot problem you will have a good hose that will last a long time.I'd say using it just to wash your car isn't a bad idea, but dragging the hose across the yard to rinse off things (and water the garden) IS a bad idea because the knots will continue to occur, so you'll have to keep walking all the way back to where the hose begins to straighten it out.  If you think that's not a problem go ahead and get one.\",\n",

I have never had a reason to take advantage of the lifetime warranty, but other reviewers indicate that Glimour makes good on their promise even decades later.  I've noticed a few negative reviews here where the reviewer is mistakenly commenting on a completely different hose.\",\n",

Buy it now.Longer review:I bought a home depot memorial day special hose for $19.95 (same size as this one) and thought \"how different can hoses be?  this one says kink free.\"  Three months of hose torture ensued, with me trying various tactics (e.g. only moving hose when it\\'s pressurized) to try to keep it from kinking.  That damn endless kink hose is now in a pile in a garage ready for donation.  It has more kinks in it than a Russian porn movie.

       " \"Strong and durable I thought I had already reviewed this hose.  We love it!  It is strong and it attaches easily and smoothly to each other (we bought TWO 100' lengths) without leaking.  I expect these hoses to last us a terrifically long time.\",\n",
       " 'UPDATE:  Kinks Easily & Difficult to Handle UPDATE:  Originally, I gave this hose 5 stars but after using them (I bought 3) for a while, I\\'ve changed my opinion. Yes, the hoses appear to be well made and are lighter weight than my old professional grade rubber hoses, but Flexogens are still heavy. These Flexogen hoses DO kink, and they kink easily. The only way to reduce the kinking is to completely unroll the entire 100 feet of hose from the reel, lay it flat on the grund, and then turn and turn and turn (twist/rotate) it until it lays completely flat -- make sure there are no \"waves\" or loops. I pulled about 50 feet off the hose reel and, holding the end, walked across my yard. I did not stop to twist out the waves and loops that it formed while unrolling. The hose formed 9 kinks! What a pain in the hand, elbow and shoulder to straighten it! This process wastes time.The second problem is after I screw on my hose wand and turn on the water, this hose becomes unwieldy. The hose turns so that my wand is upside down. It requires a LOT of effort to twist the hose and hold it so the wand sprays downward--requires using both hands. Fighting this hose is painful, very tiring and aggravating.When you rewind it onto a hose reel, the hose twists and turns, causing it to again form waves and loops, which become kinks. Again, you have to twist, rotate, etc. to get all the waves/loops out so the hose lays flat and straight on the ground. As you reel it in, you have to stop and repeat the process. My old commercial-grade hose never did anything like this. You can buy the professional/commercial grade hoses (100 ft) at big box stores and clubs for about $25. Don\\'t buy the Flexogen.Due to age and arthritis in my hands, I needed to replace my heavy, rubber commercial-grade garden hoses with lighter weight, easier-to-maneuver hoses. I was barely able to wind the old rubber hoses on the hose reel or drag them around the yard. After reading reviews on Amazon and other places for garden hoses, I chose this hose. I\\'m glad I did. While it\\'s still heavy, it weighs considerably less than my commercial-grade rubber hose. It\\'s easier to wind on the reel and easier to drag around the yard.The Amazon description calls this a \"lightweight\" hose. It is NOT  light. It\\'s substantial. I found a local store that  had this hose in 25-, 50- and 75-ft lengths. I was able to lift each and compare to heavy duty hoses of the same length. I couldn\\'t feel much of a difference, so I definitely would call this a medium- to heavy-weight hose (but lighter than my rubber one).This hose is easier to handle than my old rubber ones because it\\'s more flexible. (I suspect that my old hoses have stiffened over the years.)I\\'ve only used one (I bought 3 of these) for about 1.5 weeks. It\\'s been too hot, too muggy and too rainy to use it much, but I\\'m pleased so far. I believe this hose is a very good quality and should last many years. The solid brass fittings are thick so they won\\'t get dents that cause leaks. Because I haven\\'t dragged it around the yard yet, I cannot say whether it really is a \"no-kink\" hose.

Blistered hands and time wasted, I decided there had to be a better way and this is surely it.Edging is one of those necessary evils if you want a great looking house. I don't edge every time I mow. Usually I do it every other time. The first time out after a long winter, edging usually takes a little longer. After that, edging is a snap because you are basically in maintanence mode.I also use this around my landscaping and flower beds with equally great results.The blade on the Edge Hog is easily replaceable and the tell tale sign to replace it is when the edge starts to look a little rough and the machine seems slower.\",\n",

The new unit is lighter and seems to have more power, though that may be because of the new brushes working better.  The one BIG change is the guard over the blade.  It is too soon to tell if this is an improvement or just a way to save money on their part.  It certainly is less safe.The older model had a &#34;swing open&#34; cover which protected the blade almost completey above the ground level.  Good part about that was not being able to get fingers or toess into the cutting area.  Bad part was having to stop for built up grass, or when the ground was wet, built up mud.  You'd have to stop and open the door to clean out the area.The newer model doesnot have a cover and most of the blade area is open.  There is something akin to a bicycle fender covering the blade for protection.  The first day I used it, the ground was wet and dirt built up in the shield, but not enough to really bog down the blade.  I unplugged the unit for safety sake, but unlike the older model, you needed a big screwdriver to pull out all the mud.  If you use it on dry ground, the newer model will have less build up of grass than the older one.I am hoping to get at least eight years out of this unit, like I did with my last one.\",\n",
       " 'Super Edger The Black & Decker LE750 Edge Hog 2-1/4 HP Electric Landscape Edger is so easy to use and does a great job of edging my lawn. I purchased this edger because I became so tired of trying to edge my lawn with a string trimmer. The string trimmer did a choppy job, but the B&D edger makes a nice and neat edge on my lawn. Before this purchase I dreaded the job. The fact that this edger can also make trenches is a big plus. I am a female senior citizen and care for my lawn myself. Anything that makes that job easier (like this edger) deserves five stars. I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs an edger that is easy to use and does a good job.',\n",
       " \"Good enough edger, not so great for trenching It wouldn't be too difficult to design a wider cutting blade that would create a wider 'trench' (although the motor might need some beefing up to handle the additional load) and it would be great if it was easier to get more depth too (it's possible but requires a little backyard re-engineering).  It's worth what it costs, though...I'm basically satisfied.\",\n",

       " \"Best value in an edger, gas or electric. This is the latest version of an edger B&amp;D has been making for at least 20 years, and there are plenty of the 20 year old models still in use. It's nearly silent, much easier to use than a gas model, and seems to  cut better with less stalling than my neighbor's 3.5HP gas model.\",\n",
       " \"Cuts Florida St. Augustine Grass Like Butter This edger does the job and more.  I give it my highest recommendation.I hadn't edged my lawn since last Fall when my gas-powered edger bit the dust.  We have St. Augustine grass here in Florida.  It propagates by spreading tough, vine-like runners.  I had these in spades creeping over my driveway and over onto the concrete rain channel gutter in front of our house.  This edger cut right through them, which I didn't expect, given the toughness of the grass.  But it never hesitated, except on some very stuborn growth.  I just backed up and hit it again and away the edger went, without even breathing hard.  Even the gas-powered edger wasn't this good.The secondary handle and the adjustable edge guide are quite helpful.  I never felt like this edger had taken control and gone where I didn't want it to go.  Its light weight, easy rolling wheels and great cutting power more than compensate for the 100-ft extension cord it's tethered to.  I think it took me as long to rewind the cord as it took to edge the grass (total edging is about 200-225 linear feet).  Also it has two large wheels in the back and one at the front, so it stays level and makes it easy to push in a straight line.  With the edge guide that rides against the driveway or walkway there was very little of the sparking caused by the blade hitting the concrete.This is about as easy as it gets.  No more gas and oil mix, no more new spark plugs, no more 15-20 pulls to get the engine to start, and it's relatively quiet when running.  Just press the trigger and go.  Love it, love it, love it.\",\n",
       " 'Easy to operate, does an A+ job I love this edger!  I have been using it for almost 2 years, and it is still going strong.  It has plenty of power, yet is easy to maneuver.I get a beautiful, straight edge along my sidewalk from using this tool.  It is so easy to guide in a straight line.  I also use it to keep a trench space between my grass and my landscaped areas, which has worked much better than a trimmer.We had a gas powered edger before this one, but it was too heavy for me.  I actually enjoy yard work, but rarely did it because the tools we had were difficult for me to manage.  Now that I have this electric edger, which is significantly lighter without the gas tank, as well as a manual mower, I do most of the yard work, and love it!',\n",
       " \"For small yards I've purchased a lot of B&D product and edger is one of the best! The trench feature is a great addition and it works great.  I can edge my small yard in minutes and I don't have to worry about mixing fuel or having to winterize my equipment.\",\n",
       " \"More than an Edger If you need an edger, and don't want the trouble of maintaining a gas-powered edger, this is the electric edger for you.

The benefit of this system is that cutting is easier as it constantly replaces worn out string, the down side that the usage of the string is faster than when done manually.I have tried wounding the string by hand and found it a bit cumbersome and a bit time consuming, so I figured less than $5 per spool is not to bad to save me 5 minutes of time wounding and dealing with jammed string. Each spool contains 30 feet of 0.065 inch diameter round line. It is factory spooled and is wound tighter than when I wound the spool by hand.To replace the spool:1. Remove battery2. Squeeze the tabs on the spool cap to release it3. Pull the empty spool out by pulling directly away from the housing4. Clean out the housing from debris5. Make sure that the level that controls the spooling  is aligned with the edge of the housing6. Take a string from the new spool and feed it through the eyelet in the housing7. Push the spool into the housing and rotate it until it feels seated and the tabs of the spool align with the holes in the housing8. Put the cap back on9.

Once the factory-wound spool ran out, the line never again fed properly.

I spent at least as much time rewinding the spool as I did trimming grass.  Then I found the model Black & Decker trimmer that takes disposable spools -- like these.  They're a godsend.  Perhaps it's more economical to wind your own spool, but if your time (and blood pressure) mean anything to you, disposable spools are the way to go.

I do love this bug zapper, but I noticed there weren't as many dead bugs around it as I thought there would be, seeing as we have a heavily wooded property complete with creek (lots of bugs!).  One late night, almost midnight, I went out into the side yard with my dog so she could do her business, and saw BATS flying from the woods and zooming by the bug zapper, then back to the trees again.  The bats were picking off the bugs that were attracted by the bug zapper!  How cool is that?!?  I am such a city kid that I made myself a cup of hot cocoa and sat by the back door with the porch light on, just watching the bats go back and forth.  Since that evening, I've seen the bats almost every time I happen to go outside late at night, so I guess my bug zapper is doing well to keep our local bats fat and happy.  (I'm glad to say the bats are in no danger from this zapper due to the grid guard, btw.)I've had this 80 watt model for over 3 months now, and it works beautifully even though it's exposed to the wind, rain, and hail.  Depending on how warm the weather has been, I'll take the leaf blower to it to clean the bug zapper every week or two.

After 100 hours or so of use the linkages wear.  After more hours the fiberglass handles become flexible and fracture where the rivets go through them.  We have figured out how to rebuild/repair both of these areas.  In seven years two blades have broken.  Replacement blades can be purchased from the Corona website.

I was pruning deadwood inside a hedge with little clearance for the handles, so the jaws were not fully open and the cuts were being made near the tip of the blade and anvil.  User error.  Not only did the pruner cut poorly in this position, but also the blade tended to twist.  Finally I figured out this pruner comes into its own when cutting deep in the V.  That is where its power comes into play and that is where the pruner works very well. Not sure why the difference, but there it is.

So I had to pursue a different path to keep the cats out.I did, however, keep using this material to keep birds and other unwanted pests (moths, butterflies, etc.) out of my garden.  Having another pair of hands around to help with installation is good because this material tangles easily and snags on just about everything, including itself.  So you need to exercise care when putting it on otherwise it will rip.

       " \"A Tool That Really Helps Get it Done I bought my garden claw several years ago. I was looking for something to help turn compost into my vegetable gardens.The criterion I was looking for was something inexpensive that wouldn't break the bank the way a tiller would. But would still get the job done without causing me to be laid up with back pain for a week. For the most part I have been very pleased.We have 2- 12'x12',and  2-8'x8' beds  along with a few smaller freestyle plots, and we mainly use the claw to add compost and cow manure to them every Spring . With the claw I am able to quickly mix in my amendments, and to loosen up the soil about a half foot down in next to no time. If I want to go extra deep, it does take a double dose of clawing , but it is worth it in the end. And it really is not that much extra work since the soil has been pre-loosened a bit by the first go around.As far as starting a bed from scratch, I have used it to start new plots, but only after the sod has been removed. I do think it would be a tough chore to try to do a new bed from start to finish, with only the Claw,and without removing the grass first, but not impossible.When weeding I find it invaluable for use in between rows. It is a breeze to simply stick the claw into the center of a clump of weeds and give a twist and a tug and be done.My one complaint is that the handle has come a tad bit loose. It is still perfectly functional and it took about 5 or more years of good solid use for that to happen, but for someone with a larger plot who uses it more often it may be a concern.\",\n",
       " 'Handles are on backwards! We bought the Garden Claw several years ago at our first house and never used it, because the handles are mounted for lefties.  That is, the two hand-grips are each curved to the side, giving a feel of turning a wheel when you use it.  This would be great if you put your hands on the grips and turned it to the right to dig.  But the tines on this gadget are positioned so that you have to \"steer\" the Claw to the left to get them to dig.  Since us righties have more strength in our right hands, it was very awkward to \"steer\" the Claw to the left.  We spent about 20 minutes with it in the garden that day and haven\\'t used it since.',\n",

The handles work well to gain leverage, but you will feel it in your muscles if you  attempt to do too large an area!The fact that it isn't powered lets  you get into areas you wouldn't want to go with even the smallest of  tillers, and it does a great job of breaking up the ground to a depth of a  couple of inches, which is perfect for flowers.For larger projects, use  a mini-tiller, and use this tool for the detail work and the smaller beds.

       " \"Nothing To Brag About A couple of years ago my husband decided to shove our old mower in the shed and buy this push mower with the sharpening kit and grass catcher. His motivation was that this mower would not pollute and was ecologically responsible.While it isn't hard to maintain or use and it can be adjusted for height easily, I am a finicky type and I really don't care for the job this mower does. I miss the good old days when my lawn looked perfectly manicured with neat paths of freshly mowed grass.The positive in regard to this mower is that it cuts a wide path which theoretically is time saving and efficient. The negatives are more numerous. The handle on this mower has fatigued 6 times in two years. I have ordered replacement handles a couple times after duct taping proved to be a poor fix at best. The grass catcher has been replaced twice because it fell apart. We are on our second sharpening set. The most irritating aspect  of having this mower is that it does a poor job if the grass gets too long between mowings. The weird weather conditions this spring has resulted in my grass seeding twice and growing like crazy. Long strands of germinating grass stand in contrast to the parts that actually do get cut. Most of the time, my husband mows the lawn twice in an attempt to get it even. Usually that makes little difference as to the lawn's overall appearance.This is a cheap mower. It might be great for someone who has a small yard, but my yard isn't small. This mower Isn't even close to my grandpa's old push mower that really tamed an unruly lawn and was solid.  Last night I had to order a new handle and another sharpening kit.Today I am going to buy a nice power driven Toro and I'll mow the lawn from now on.\",\n",
       " 'You gotta try this! Everyone I know advised me against getting a reel mower.  I was cautioned that they don\\'t cut well and they\\'re hard to push.  But I didn\\'t consider a gas mower an option (too expensive, noisy, hard to maintain, and dangerous), a corded electric would be too cumbersome, and a rechargeable would be impractical because there is not a convenient place for me to charge it.  So I took the plunge and bought this one.I\\'m completely intimidated by all things mechanical, so I was worried about assembling this mower, but it really is easy.  The only thing you have to do is screw the five sections of the handle together, then clip it onto the mower body.  The instructions were adequate (3.5 stars there), even for an assembly-phobe like me.  The current configuration does not require any tools for assembly, but there was an add-on bag of washers and nuts included with my mower that are recommended for a more securely assembled handle.  If you opt to use the new nuts instead of the original wingnuts, you\\'ll need a wrench.After just fifteen minutes or so, I was up and running.  To my delight, the mower pushes easily, even through long grass.  And it\\'s very entertaining to watch the grass being rapidly snipped off.  I felt like Edward Scissorhands.  Who would have thought mowing grass would be so fun?  I was a little tired and winded when I finished (in a good way), but I had been practically running with this thing because I enjoyed it so much.  I kept looking for stray patches to go over again, but, alas, the mower did such a good job, when I was finished, my yard looked like a golf course.A few facts about me and my lawn to see if my wholehearted recommendation will apply to you:  I\\'m female, plus-sized, totally out of shape, and usually quite sedentary (one reason I thought this would be a good idea).  I had never mowed grass before in my life (didn\\'t have a yard before last summer, and then I accepted the fine services of a neighborhood girl with a ride-on mower who worked cheap).  My yard is about 6500 square feet, level, fairly flat, and covered with long pine needles all over the place (the mower didn\\'t even notice them).Some older reviews address a couple of problems that are no longer an issue:  Scotts now (late April 2007) packages the mower with the cushioned handgrip already on, and the apparently easily loosened wingnuts (as already mentioned) can now be replaced with regular nuts (not mentioned in the current manual, but included in the box with a note).  Scotts should have included shorter bolts with the new nuts (since you now don\\'t need the extra length the wingnuts required), but this is a trivial point.  Put your wingnuts on after the new nuts for a more \"finished\" appearance.A reel mower might not be suitable for everyone and every yard, but for me, it\\'s fantastic.  It\\'s quiet, easy to maneuver, non-intimidating, good exercise, fun, environmentally sound, and inexpensive.  I couldn\\'t be happier with this mower.UPDATE 1-17-13I used my mower for the whole season and never had any problems with it.  The next year, health issues forced me to again use the services of the neighborhood girl to mow my lawn.  Then I got married, and my husband wanted nothing to do with a reel mower (though he admitted that it was cool, he\\'d always used a gas mower, and that\\'s what he wanted to stick with, though I HATE the noise and smell when he mows).  So my Scotts sat in storage for years, and last fall Hubby finally convinced me to let it go.  I sold it for $50 to a single mom with a tween daughter who was going to mow their small lawn.  I let them try it out on our grass, and they were both immediately thrilled and couldn\\'t wait to get home to use it.  I felt like I was kind of passing on a torch.

       " \"snip, snip It's a classic all right, but a clever classic.  This mower is a straight forward push reel mower with a few nice touches.  That second set of wheels replace a roller all right and the clever height adjustment let's you know that someone gave some thought to this device.  One of the one-star complaints regarding this mower involves the difficulty pushing it.  Well, you can alleviate that by simply adjusting the closeness of the blade  or even the angle of the cut; mine was initially a real bear because the blade was factory adjusted to such a closeness that the reel blades added enormously to the drag, far more than the grass did.  Once you've tapped in an adjustment to the closeness of the blade to its stropping plate (remember just 1/4 turn at the most and oil all the blades) it'll be close to effortless.  The main thing, however, is that reel mowers do such a pretty cut.\",\n",
       " 'Reel Easy to Use Works like a charm. Put it together in a few minutes and cut an overgrown yard at a cabin. Had to make two passes - one at the highest length and one at desired length. The tall weeds did not cut, but I cut them with a lopper. Much easier to maneuver than my power mower and trimmer-mower.',\n",
       " 'Not going green, just saving gas money... I have had many people look at and watch me as I mowed our lawn for the first time with this reel mower and all I could think is that these people think I\\'m going green... well I\\'m not. I have always lived a conservative life, recycled (still do), and so on. And not because some celebrity told me I should or whatever, but because it just makes sense to do so. So with that out of the way, onto the actual product.When gas prices peaked last summer we stopped using our lawn tractor because it used just too much gas (and it didn\\'t cut the grass all that well to begin with) and just used our self propelled Honda mower. Well after the tractor sat all summer we decided to just sell it and buy a reel mower and so far it has more then paid for itself.The first question EVERYONE asks is, is it hard to push? Plain and simple, NO. These new reel mowers are lighter and are better designed so they are much easier to push then the old Leave It To Beaver style reel mowers. Also the rear stabilizer wheels also makes it easier to handle.The second question that is asked is, how well does it cut the grass. Well that depends on how tall the grass is, how wet it is, etc.. A reel mower cuts with a sheering action (like scissors) instead of a tearing action that is associated with a rotary mower. This leaves your grass in a much healthier state then the tearing action does. Now I will say that it is harder to cut tall grass and we have to mow more often, but that\\'s the nature of the beast.After mowing the lawn for a few weeks with the Scotts 20 inch reel mower I can actually tell a difference in the grass, much better and healthier looking.The only gripe I have is the handle is a bit flimsy and wobbles a lot... kind of a pain when you execute a turn. We\\'ll probably end up welding it together so it doesn\\'t wobble.All said and done it\\'s a bit more work then using our self propelled Honda, but produces a much better looking lawn.Pros:Fairly cheap upfront cost.Little to no upkeep.Leaves your lawn looking awesome.At least ten times quieter then pretty much any rotary mower, thus allows your to keep your windows open when you are mowing.No fumes (darnit I love the smell of gas!).20\" mower path.Cons:Made in China...Some plastic pieces, not sure how they are going to last but we\\'ll see.Wobbly handle.',\n",
       " 'Great mower, lousy handle I really like this mower a lot.  I have owned a Brill and Sunlawn, but I like the Scotts classic better than either.  I do have a 40 year old Scotts Deluxe that is substantially heavier and which I like the best of all.  I use the old Scotts Deluxe for mowing my own yard and leave the Scotts classic in my trunk to mow rentals.  Here are my pros and cons.Pros.1. Heavier than others.  That makes it less likely to slip when going over uneven lawn or wet grass. It also has more reel momentum making it cut tall floppy grass and leaves better.2. Handle comes off easily.  There are little clips that hold the handle in, but I do not use them. I just pop the handle on and off, making it easy to store in my trunk and use any time.3.  No gas, much, much lighter and smaller than a gas mower. Of course this is true of all reel mowers, but it is an important point for me.  I can leave this in my trunk and not worry about gas fumes or about refilling gas.  It is always ready to go.  With the handle off, it does not take up too much of my trunk and it is light enough to easily take in and out of my trunk.4. Durable.  You might not think of this with a reel mower, but it saves me nice money in maintenance.  I actually mow several rental lawns weekly.  With that much mowing I have to take my mower in for maintenance every year.  Also I have bent the crankshaft on multiple mowers.  The only maintenance on this is sharpening the blade.5.  Easy to sharpen the blade.  This mower is made by American Lawn Mower, which means it can use the very easy, very cheap american lawn mower sharpening kit available from amazon and tons of other places for under $20.  I like the kit and feel I get a better cut with this mower than I did with the brill or sunlawn models.6. Quiet. Maybe it is a little louder than the brill, but it is still super quiet.  If I feel like mowing in the middle of the night, just because I can, I do and it bothers noone.  Now when I use a gas mower, the noise really bothers me.Cons.1. Handle is super flexy.  They really cheaped out on the handle. The sunlawn and brill models are much stronger.  It works and lasted a heavy use season, but it will not last as long as the body.2. Tough time with weeds. Like all reel mowers, this thing does not like to mow anything that is tall and floppy. This one handles weeds and tall grass much better than average, but you should still try to hold down the weeds and cut weekly if possible. That being said my sister often forgets to mow her weedy lawn for a few weeks, and I am able to mow it with my Scotts classic when her sunlawn would have more difficulty.',\n",
       " \"For folks who LOVE Grass. Not for people who HATE gas powered tools I hate gas powered tools! I bought this as a hopeful solution to that problem. Obstacles are a definite problem. The maneuverability is quite limited. With a gas mower you could tilt the back end up and over some small obstacles. That wasn't the biggest problem. A little extra weed whipping to be done. The biggest problem is the quality of the cut. If your grass is not perfect plush growth like a golf course the cut will be OK not great. This mower is for people who LOVE grass. Not for people who HATE gas powered tools because you have to mow almost every other day. I hate mowing and grass. I mow mine down to the ground every time and hope it doesn't rain so I wont have to do it again for 2-4 weeks. Some people coddle their grass. They think of it as a family member. They talk about their grass non-stop. They can have a discussion about bagging over mulching for over an hour. They have chemicals for weed control, ants, grubs, PH balance, feed. They seed and water regularly. They spend several hundred dollars every year on their lawns. Their passion for their grass is second only to their family. If this sounds like you, great! It's great to have a passion and this mower is for you. If you mow your lawn down to the dirt and curse at gas powered tools and HATE mowing. This mower is not for you.\",\n",
       " 'Good Choice......But only if you have the time to mow more often I wish I could say that I purchased this mower after seeing Al Gores \"inconvenient truth\" and my life was changed by it.  The truth however is that I finally got fed up with my old power mower failing to start for the ump-teenth time after repeated repairs and promises of it now \"running like a champ\".  This old time mower will take some getting used too, and also don\\'t kid yourself, it doesn\\'t do the job as easily as a power mower by any means.  However on the plus side you will never again suffer through a mower that fails you, needs fuel, requires any real maintenance like oil changes or plugs, and best of all if you take care of it, will be the very last mower you ever buy.  The only way this mower will up and quit is if you do.  Any maintenance it does require is easily handled by a screwdriver or wrench.  Even for those whose knowledge of small gas engines doesn\\'t go much beyond kicking it and swearing when it disappoints you. I fully agree with the reviewer here who stated it is best used on pristine lawns with lush healthy grass. (Unfortunately a lot of people that have lawns of such quality often don\\'t cut their own lawns. If you happen to be the exception, read on) This mower cuts thick grass of reasonable length straight and evenly very easily.  Where it fails you is on long loose weeds fluttering in the wind.  The mower passes right over them no matter how many times you try again and again to sever it.  I solved that problem by putting a little more effort into trimming with the weed whacker, and leaving the heavy grass to the mower.  And it by far is most efficient when used regularly once or twice a week.  A time table you will find effortlessly fits most peoples lifestyle since the mower is so light and easy to use that mowing the lawn will no longer be an all day Saturday event.  Unlike lawns where power mowers are used that usually get long and seedy looking in between jobs, you will find yourself taking this mower out far more often just to hit the \"high spots\".  Thus your lawn comes to have the appearance of a man that gets his hair cut every three weeks and thus never looks like he is long overdue.  You can also get away with using this mower early in the morning or late in the evening since it makes very little racket. And one last thing, I didn\\'t notice much difference in the physical effort needed to push it considering that most people use walk behind push mowers in any event.  Aside from having to use it a little more often, and its lack of cutting power on long weeds, I consider this mower to be well worth one\\'s investment.  You will eventually come to find your lawn never looked better.',\n",

       " \"Broke on Second Use I was really looking forward to trying out a reel mower and living a life of maintenance free mowing. It didn't work out. The second time I used it, the grass had gotten a little high, so there was a lot of back and forth action. It took forever, really. I know that this product isn't meant for that, but that was my situation. Anyway, as I was finishing the handle came apart. There are four wingnuts and bolts holding the assembly together, and one on each side had apparently worked their way off while I was mowing without me noticing. The third one came off as I was putting it away and the handle came apart.Yeah, I was putting a lot of stress on it compared to a regular mowing, but that should not have happened. I followed the assembly instructions to the letter. It was really a very simple assembly. I didn't miss any steps or try to do it without reading the instructions, though. I was very disappointed with this product.If you have a flat yard and are going to be able to keep it mowed short without ever letting it get out of hand AT ALL (like leaving town for a couple weeks), this mower may be for you.If you have a sloped, lumpy yard, do not buy this product. Just don't. It is so hard to use. I honestly think I would like it if I had a nice, flat yard, but as it is this thing was worthless to me.\",\n",
       " 'Little Green Mower I ordered my Scotts 20\" Classic Mower on Earth Day and because I had to put it together, I finally used it for the first time in mid-May. I wish all I had to do was put in two screws and be done but there were 5 big pieces to the handle and lots of little pieces (fortunately almost all the same set of pieces). I could put it together with only a little difficulty and I don\\'t have much practice at putting things together. I couldn\\'t get the E-rings in. My husband managed that.The handle flexes. I wondered if that was needed to handle the bumps, but after using it I don\\'t think it is. I think it is just cheap. The mower part feels more substantial.  It is made in China. I wonder how many years of not using my gas mower it will take to make up for transporting this from China.In the reviews people talked about it stopping suddenly. I had the same issue. I have a very small yard; it is level except for a few odd little depressions. At those spots as well as at random moments the mower would freeze up. It happened some times when the clippings kind of got clogged on the back guard. Other times, I could not see why it stopped. It went right over the small sticks in my yard, which I was happy about. On the other hand, all the dandelions just bent over and snapped right back up after I passed over them. I had a few spots where I went at the grass from a few directions before it mowed. Once I got it going it tended to keep going, but every corner meant a full stop and then had to try to get `er rolling again. Next time, I\\'ll see if I can figure out a way to mow with less full corners. As I said it is a small yard, so I\\'m not sure it will work.Overall I am happy with the product except for the issues I mentioned above. I didn\\'t want to spend too much, so for the price this is about what I expected. I plan to use this every other time I mow. I\\'m keeping the gas mower to get through the weeds and plants that are out of control. As I\\'m growing more native plants and food, my area of grass is decreasing.',\n",

But I took the chance and am very glad I did.  It's much easier to manage than the gas mower I was using (not self propelled),  and does a good job on the lawn.  If you are looking for a perfectly even lawn this may not be for you, but I don't mind an occasional weed sticking up here or there.  The higher height setting seems to allow the mower to go over most small twigs, which was another concern of mine.  I mow each &#34;section&#34; of my lawn once per week, so the grass does not get too high.  Also I switch mowing directions each time.  If you are not able to keep up with your lawn this probably isn't for you as it does best when cutting about 1/3 of the length of the grass.  Using this mower might take me a bit longer than using the gas powered one, but not by much.  And it's a whole lot quieter and easier to maintain.\",\n",
       " \"The Second Best Machine Available I am a great fan of manual mowers for small yards, although that wasn't always the case. When I was a small lad one fo my shores was to mow a double lot with an old, heavy manual mower, something that soured me on manual mowers for decades. But a few years ago I discovered the new generation of manual mowers, and now I mow my lawn in about the time it took with my gas mower, but without the noise, the vibrations or the fumes. I can mow at 7 in the morning, or 9 at night without bothering the neighbors, too.The Scott has a number of good things going for it: It's light, easy to push, fairly easy to adjust, and you can sharpen it yourself with a simple kit. That alone will save a bit of money. It's my favorite unit in its price class. (My favorite mower is the Brill, from Germany, which is even lighter and easier to push  than the Scott and doesn't require sharpening for 8 years, but which Amazon doesn't carry... yet.)If you do buy the Scott, get the sharpening kit, as when you do need it you'll want to have it on hand. And get a can of Boeshield protectant spray (also available from Amazon). A quick once over with the Boeshield from time to time will greatly extend the life of your mower and keep it easy to push.\",\n",

There's some effort to push it, but it's actually easier in some ways than using a power mower; for example, the lighter weight of this mower makes it far easier to change directions in a tight space.  It's easy to adjust the height of the cut, as well.I'll just note one small problem that I've had and two limitations of all mowers of this type.  There is a thin foam pad on the top of the handle.  On mine, it split on the left side the first time that I used the mower, which isn't a big deal.  Mr. Shenker in his excellent review reports that his mower will cut long grass.  Mine leaves long grass uncut.  I believe that this is simply a limitation of reel mowers in general.  Also, it's probably more important to make sure that the ground is dry with any mower that you power yourself, simply because you need traction on the ground to make the blades turn, and this, in turn, makes it more likely that you'll skid on any mud.  With those limitations, however, I can unhesitatingly recommend this mower.\",\n",

It is ideal if you have a small lawn or want to get a little exercise while mowing. The downside to any push mower is that apparently they require a special skill set to sharpen the blades & most garden shops do not sharpen the blades.  I was able to find one place that sharpens blades in the entire area and it is not cheap. It's not a good idea to do it yourself, quite dangerous, & dull blades are useless. The blades seemed to dull very quickly, if that is possible - maybe they weren't very sharp to begin with. I hope more people will buy push mowers, which will force more shops to consider getting the tools so they can offer sharpening. I have 4 friends who all have the same problem. This has nothing to do with the mower itself, just know that before you buy it, research your area to make sure there is someone who can sharpen it for you.\",\n",

Like a few other reviewers have said it does get stuck on any little twig.  So you might have to stop a few times to bend over and pick them out, but if you're the reel mower type I would assume bending over a few times isn't out of the question.

       " 'Works great (but some confusion with refill sizes) I\\'ve used this and a few other similar Jiffy products the last several years to start seeds for my garden. They are very easy to use (add hot water per the directions to expand the included pellets, then plant seeds per packet instructions) and less messy than using seed starting mix in flats--and perhaps even easier as well, though probably a bit more expensive. A clear plastic cover/dome is included to help germination. When the seedlings are ready to pot up or transplant, the netting tears off very easily and allows for transplanting with minimal root disturbance. Some people also leave the netting on and I seem to remember reading that it\\'s supposed to disintegrate, but that hasn\\'t been my experience. You do have to be careful with larger-rooted plants (squash, etc.) that you take care of them before their roots start to grow through the netting, otherwise you\\'ll probably shock them more if/when you remove it. Finally, I like the square shape of this tray because it allows me to evenly rotate the plants under my grow lights.However, there are a few things you should know that don\\'t seem to be made clear. Jiffy sells refill pellets so you can use the tray again, ideally saving money--but they have several similar-looking products that take different-sized pellets, so you need to know which ones you need. This 25-cell tray takes 42mm pellets (not 30, 36, or 50mm, which they also sell). Jiffy sells the 25-pack ofJiffy 5777 Refills, which are the right size. They used to be almost as expensive on Amazon as this complete kit, but as of my writing they are now an add-on item for about half the cost. Beware of third-party sellers; for example, I see a 200-pack of supposedly 42mm pellets,Jiffy 7 Peat Soil 42mm Pellets, but they were actually the wrong size, so I had to return them. You may also be able to find them locally. Just be sure you get the right size, which is the 42mm size, sold under the \"Jiffy 5777\" name. Jiffy does not make sizing clear on either the original product or the refill, both of which would be a great help.Finally, I will note that because of the availability of refills, I was hoping to save money by re-using the tray for a few years and just replacing the pellets. However, after saving two trays from last season (both inside under good, climate-controlled conditions), one became slightly warped and curled up towards the outside, making it undesirable for use since I\\'m not sure if my plants would fall over with this slight curl of the tray. It also developed a small crack in the bottom, which is important to be aware of if you\\'re using (and watering) these inside as I assume most people do. Obviously, these are just thin plastic and not something I\\'d expect to keep for years and years, but I was hoping to at least get a couple years\\' use out them.

It sometimes will get knocked down so will look like its trigger and there's no real way to tell without opening it.

       " \"Works like a charm A family of field mice moved into the house.  They are soooo tiny I wasn't sure what trap to use but this looked the lightest.  I caught the whole family within a few hours - even the babies. The secret as many have already said is keep in in their path and along the wall - I knew where they were coming from so it made that part easy.  Also, like already mentioned - just a dap of peanut butter - especially if trying to catch small mice.\",\n",
       " \"Mice trip Kness Tip-Trap by walking ON it... flawed by design Recently I've been researching mice and other vermin as they pertain to farmstead habitation.Knowing that they must be removed from chicken coops and feed storage areas, it's nice to have options that do not require poison, nor snap a mouse/vole/rat to death and leave it for animals to pick at and possibly get sick from.Your cat, dog and other pets may get access to dead animals in traditional traps, so these enclosed live catch traps seemed like a great idea.I purchased four and placed them on a shelf where mouse droppings were noted.  I also places a motion activated camera so I could better see how they were or were not being trapped by the device.Within one 24 hour period, three out of four traps placed were tripped with nothing at all inside.  Upon video and still image review, a Deer Mouse had trotted over the top of the three traps that were tripped and of course activated them without being inside.The third trap remained unsprung, but the Deer Mouse only sniffed the opening and failed to enter.With all four traps re-set for another go, the Deer Mouse now just scampers around each trap and doesn't bother with them at all.I have added a photo of the setup and mouse to the collection of photos submitted by buyers/reviewers.I like the idea of the tilt trap and in theory it's great, in practical use it's simply not effective.  There are many solutions to this problem:The most popular is to simply put a cardboard box over the tilted UP end, through a hole that is cut just slightly taller than the trap at the fulcrum.  This allows the trap to activate, but does not allow the mouse to stand ON the tipped up section.  As this is an innovation which isn't already a part of the trap, I am giving my two star rating on the traps as designed.It also wouldn't hurt to make them larger with an adjustable balance weight... the buyer can of course make any number of modifications and the system is already being copied and improved by other companies... I guess this is an example of another weak patent registration process.So, I sadly would not recommend these to friends and others wanting to rid themselves of mice quickly.... but IF you enjoy the process of problem solving and using these as a starting point, you will certainly foil the mice and end up collecting them in short order.Look for the design which has a housing over the tipped up portion... it's better.\",\n",
       " 'Works well We have several traps to deal with the mice that love our garage - this trap works well, but the one improvement would be to have the case transparent so you can see the contents.  When the mouse goes in, the trap rocks and the door closes and latches - this all works well, but the trap frequently closes without a mouse.',\n",
       " 'This is why the reviews aren\\'t great I read the negative reviews and bought the trap anyway because I wanted a humane trap; just couldn\\'t bring myself to kill the one mouse that seemed to have snuck into my house.  I posted a picture; the trap is smaller than a dollar bill.  I found that I was \"waiting up\" and checking the mousetrap every half hour, because any mouse that it caught would certainly die rather quickly in there.  A traditional mouse trap would be more humane if one couldn\\'t release the catch within minutes of a trap.  I never did catch a mouse with it; I grew tired of checking the thing too often...I wish the trap were just a little bit bigger... but as it is, it is too small for a mouse to live for more than a few minutes.',\n",

Didn't know how many mice we had, but caught three with this one and zero with the others and no escapes, it seems, from the others.  They were all put in the same general area.  This one worked, was easy to set, easy to bait and easy to release the mouse.\",\n",

Additionally, while listings for some other Oregon chains advise we use the selector guide found at Oregonchain.com, most do not!  Oregon makes an excellent saw chain. Each and every listing should prominently provide explicit instruction that potential buyers need to first verify the correct selection for their particular make & model, before ordering.  Do they look at all those questions customers post (will this fit my xxx model of my xxx brand)?My father\\'s Remington 16-inch electric, Model 1630A actually requires the S58, even though entering that make and model into Amazon\\'s Search field brought us directly to this listing.

A visit to the Oregon website (also suggested on the carton but nowhere in this listing) revealed that the S58 is the correct choice.....even though the description and photo of the S58 at Amazon states \"Fits Echo, John Deere and Sears Chain Saws\" with no reference to Remington!!! The Amazon listing for S58 contained an advisory to first check the selector guide at Oregon.  That advisory is not included on this listing!

I have already heard back on my return (it really pays to use the \"return function\" that can be found under your \"orders history\")and have received a complete refund!!

Hopefully, this will result in a hyperlink being inserted below, with an advisory to first verify exactly which chain fits your saw make and model.  BIG TIP NOT EMPHASIZED ENOUGH EVEN AT THE SELECTOR SITE:  \"count the number of drive links in the chain you have now, and write that number down someplace where you can find it\".  S56 chain has 56 drive links while S58 (and our Remington\\'s old chain)has 58!!I my case, the selector guide gave 4 different alternatives of 58 drive link chains for the electric saw we use behind the garage to cut up wood for splitting.  Since I have years of seasonal experience, and use a large, gas-powered, chain saw with an aggressive style of Oregon chain to fell and section trees in the woods, we chose the aggressive style chain (WARNING: this = \"far greater chance for kick-back and IS NOT for the unwary user\") which was also available at Amazon.com (not the S58 but the 91VXL058G).Lastly, this disappointment is one of the very few I have experienced in my many years and many $$ spent as a customer of Amazon. I use Oregon chains on my big Stihl saw, and have found that they cut a long time before dulling, and can be filed or re-sharpened many times over.  Recommend them highly.PS to the guy with the Poulan Pro...OMG!!!  For kicks and giggles, I looked up your saw on the selector guide.  There were some 15 or more choices and some were 56 link and others 58 link.  Yours is the best example I can see, where knowing to count drive links on the current chain is soooooooo important.',\n",

       " 'Another recommended Hummingbird Feeder ',\n",
       " 'A tiny gripe - why change what was working? We have  been feeding hummingbirds on our mountain in North Carolina for years now. The hummers have 2 clutches a year and, by late in the season, we will have 30 or 40 of them circling the feeders, claiming their territory and buzzing each other in some mock \"hummingbird wars\".  In August, we will empty one of these in a day, so we have to have multiple feeders to keep up.  This is the feeder we have always bought and they are pretty durable but once in a while a black bear will wear one out for us-so we keep a couple extra.  The feeder hangs on a piece of electrical wire that goes under the lid on top and the other end gets bent into a loop to hang on the hook.  But now they have decided to shorten the wire until it is just a few inches long after making the loop and tying the knot under the lid. I know the company must have saved about a penny on the wire length but it doesn\\'t work for us now - I have to use a 2-step ladder to hang it.  So, I\\'m off to the home store to try to find some red electrical wire that I can use to replace the one that is way too short.Beyond that, this is the feeder to use.  The glass jar cleans easily with a jar brush and the yellow flowers at the bottom pop out so you can reach in with an old toothbrush to clean the inside. The 6 positions works way better than the 4 place feeders for us due to the number of hummingbirds that are trying to feed simultaneously.  Just giving it 3 stars - hoping the company rethink their board-room decision on the attachment wire.',\n",
       " \"Finally a sturdy feeder that doesn't leak and keeps bees away(5- stars) I've gone through so many hummingbird feeders that the hummingbirds have stopped being cautious when a new one appears.  I've tried decorative blown-glass ones, lightweight plastics ones, and glass/plastic combo ones manufactured by various companies, including Garden Treasures and this one, Perky Pets.  I've tried models with built-in ant moats and others with bee guards.  If I could keep away ants, then I couldn't dissuade the bees.  And ultimately, each model either leaked or crashed to the ground due to the included but inadequate hanging methods.  Finally, however, I think I've found The One, although I combine it with theNectar Protectorto keep ants away -- more on that later.First the details:  the 30-ounce glass bottle holds a lot of nectar, far more than my single family of hummingbirds (now four in all) can consume in a week, the maximum amount of time you should leave a batch of nectar outside.  Its size, however, gives it some heft and a wider opening in the jar to aid in cleaning.  The single-piece plastic base has six, yellow-flowered ports that are too small for bees to enter and a perch that circles it.  It comes with a short piece of red-plastic wire for hanging.  It does not have a built-in ant moat or anything else to dissuade those pests.The base will not leak, as many other models do, because it is constructed of a single piece of molded plastic.  The disadvantage of that is, of course, that you cannot get inside of it to clean.  I've found that if I change the nectar twice a week -- or even, in rare cases, only once -- and rinse out the feeder thoroughly before refilling, the inside remains clean and mold-free.  I also have a set ofDroll Yankees PLB Perfect Little Brushesto clean out the ports.  Like many hummingbird feeders, this one only addresses one pest problem, bees, so you'll probably want to get a separate ant-guard.  Because this feeder hangs with a wire, which I twist several times around itself to keep it from undoing, I have to attach it more or less permanently to the ant-moat above it, making it necessary to remove both, as a single unit, when refilling.  Also, when you tip it upside down to unscrew/empty it, you'll get sugar water on your hands and on the ground, so do it in a location where it doesn't matter.  To continue keeping bees away, make sure you also rinse the outside since the dried sugar will attract them.I do not use colored nectar and instead make my own clear version (4 parts water, boiled, to 1 part sugar).  There is enough red on the feeder to attract the hummingbirds without using colored nectar.I'm giving this feeder five stars because it's the best I've encountered after eight or so attempts.  It's not perfect, but it's darn close.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann\",\n",

This year they have their eyes and tastes set on the two Perky-Pets in the back yard and not so much on the front yard\\'s other two feeders.  The key to this year\\'s success for them and us is changing the solution every two or three days and putting fill the glass to about 1/4th full.  I am here to simply order two more.  I hope you enjoy yours as much as we enjoy ours.April 29, 2012:  They\\'re back and still as beautiful as ever.  This year so far only two have shown up and I cannot determine their sex or anything.  They are still skittish and will not come to me as in the past.  It takes time.  They use these Perky-Pet 209s almost exclusively even though there are 2 other brands up.November 18, 2011:  Just a quick update.  The feeders are down, the hummers are on their way to Mexico and all is well.  After a full season of use and feeding a whole bunch of hummers I am happy to say these are the best of the best.  I usually changed the feeders every two to three days and have yet to have the first second of any problem except on some mornings the hummers would be a tad impatient with my schedule.  No leaks.  No broken roosts.  Nothing negative.  My homemade ant trap/chaser kept the glass clean on the inside.  I heard that a hand full of dried beans dropped in the glass and a few vigorous shakes would help keep the insides clean and it worked well.  Can\\'t wait for springtime and their arrival.In recent years we have bought several feeders and this is the best yet.  We have had 4 to 5 feeding stations set up and the first one to empty is this and its twin even though one is out front and the others are in the back.  With all factors the same, i.e., sugar water in a glass container this one just has more appeal and frankly I do not know why.  They will not tell me.  When it is empty they do let me know while I on the way to refill it that it sure took me long enough to get there.  I always alternate feeders and will set the empty on top of the trash can while installing the new batch of food.  When I put this one on the can they go to it even though the Brand X has food.  When I set the one with Brand X on the can they could not care less.  Right now our population has grown to about 6 but there is no way to be sure with all them mostly the same colors except the male ruby throated ones.  The like the perch better than the rest and even though the holes are the same as the others they just seem to enjoy sitting there taking a sip.  If simple, hour wasting watching appeals to anyone buy a feeder and check out several of the hummingbird websites for recipes and care.  We use 1 cup sugar to 4 cups boiled water cooled to room temperature.  The hummers are absolutely delightful and thank you Perky-Pet for the 209s.',\n",
       " \"Excellent design and great value I bought 2 of these to replace 2 older Perky Pet, 4 flower models.  The old 4 flower model has a design flaw which sometimes led to dripping and also attracted ants and wasps.  The bottle is large but the plastic bottom holds a lot of fluid as well.  It is over-sized for our needs, so I just fill it with less food.  Perky Pet should consider creating a new model based on this design but smaller.If I had a complaint, it would be with the wire for hanging the feeder.  A great solution for me was using a wire coat hanger and with pliers, fashioned a loop at one end and making a square shape after passing the wire through the hole in the feeder top. It works great, the wire is the perfect diameter for the hole in the feeder and very strong for windy days!I should mention the packaging is poorly done but it wasn't a problem for me. I can imagine a case of these in a store sitting on a shelf, with customers reaching for a box could easily result in a few being broken, as the glass bottle can easily come out of the box.The price is excellent, highly recommended.Update 7-7-2010, Just bought my 3rd...\",\n",

The hummers love the feeder and I can see it lasting for many years to come.EDITING: I am going to have to lower my rating on this. The hummingbird feeder works fine. The issue is the yellow \"bee guards.\" Did you know that bees and wasps are attracted to the color yellow? So if these \"bee guards\" (dumb name...should be called bee attractors) were any color other than yellow...like RED...then I wouldn\\'t have a nectar feeder in my yard right that I can\\'t even get to because it has so many wasps and yellow jackets on it.one more issue.

There were no gnaw marks, chew marks, bites or scratches anywhere on the nectar feeder or yellow plastic flowers. What removed them? I don\\'t know.

It's a simple design, has six feeding stations, has a shatterproof glass cylinder and holds a whopping 30 ounces!  I've never had a problem with ants climbing down the wire to the feeder (wires are better than string and hold up better in the wind).  Depending on how hungry your many hummingbirds are, the more you'll have to refill the syrup.  Perky-Pets 'high energy nectar' is good stuff, but seriously, a high concentration of sugar and red coloring does the trick.  Hummingbirds are attracted to the color red.To enhance your hummingbird traffic, supplement it with plants that look great.  The following are some of my favorites for various reasons:Butterfly Bush - comes in blue, ruby, pink and purple and attracts butterflies and hummingbirds.Bottlebrush - small evergreen tree or shrub.  Attracts hummingbirds, but can be messy with its flowers.Fuchsia - comes in bright red or purplish color and is great to hang next to your feeder and attracts hummingbirds.Morning Glory (vine) - multi-color attracts hummingbirds and grows quickly.Flowering red Currant - colorful background shrub that attracts hummingbirds, as well.Note that all these plants grow well in California, so check your local nursery for other suggestions.\",\n",

Our hummers just look at the bees gathered around the guards and laugh at them while eating the nectar.  Typical of most predators the bees attempt to chase the birds but success falls to the birds.One minor problem with the guards is that some insects are small enough to enter the mesh but too stupid to figure a way out and thusly meet their demise.

I am attaching a photo (under customer photos) of the hose I received - a green light-duty 3-ply hose. It looks just like many longer hoses I bought a local home improvement store. It is 15-feet by 5/8 inches. The hose is reinforced and comes with standard brass couplings. The couplings made good connections and do not leak even without Teflon tape.The hose came tightly wrapped which caused some kinks in the hose - I highlighted two of them in the attached photo.

The wooden handle is sturdy, doesn\\'t heat up, and is long enough that you can clean your grill while it\\'s hot (how I usually do it) My one complaint with it is since there is no angle at the head, you end up putting the brush at an angle (since you can\\'t hold it perpendicular to the grill as that would defeat the point of the 18\" handle) which means only the bristles at the very front get used. My brush has the front brass bristles worn down and full of grill gunk but 2/3rds of the bristles in the back look brand new. If the head of the brush was at an angle to the handle this brush would be way better.That said, it\\'s still a good brush.Be careful though as it seems Amazon is combining the reviews between the version of this brush that has brass bristles with the version with steel bristles.',\n",

After doing quite a bit of research and reading reviews, I decided to go with this Smokey Joe Silver.  It is absolutely unbeatable, and I would have paid double for it without blinking an eye!  While it doesn\\'t have an adjustable-height grilling surface, it\\'s quite easy to properly place the charcoal in such a way that you get exactly the heat you\\'re looking for.  I\\'ve been able to sear fish, or slow-cook buffalo wings, just by estimating the charcoal amount and placement.  I should also note that I usually use the lump type charcoal, not briquettes, and both work equally well in this grill.  Cleaning is a breeze, and so far after using it 12+ times since I got it a couple weeks ago, hasn\\'t even come close to needing it.As far as build quality goes, I really like the solid feel of the grill overall, but the legs could stand to be a bit sturdier.  They aren\\'t as weak as some reviewers have said, but it certainly is the weakest point of the grill as a whole.  The plastic handle has never gotten too hot to handle, not as some reviewers said.  The diameter of the grill could stand to be about 1/4\" larger, to keep it from wiggling around so much when you\\'re brushing it.  The vents constructions seems fantasic, they are easy to open and close, yet stay put when you need them to.  Having easy access to both top and bottom vents allows for lots of experimentation with cooking temperatures.  I love this grill to death, and I point out that fact to my fiance every time i use it (\"see, i told you this thing is friggin\\' awesome!\").  Even when I buy myself a much larger charcoal grill in the near future, I will still use this grill every time I\\'m only cooking for 1 or 2 people.',\n",

       " \"Smokey Joe Smokes! I bought my first Smokey Joe in 1992.  I am finally replacing him... not because he wore out, but because I tore him apart to use the pieces for something very important.  (It's a long story... Smokey Joe was all I had or I would have been outside all night in my car).  Anyway, I am now replacing my first SJ with another.  I'm quite certain he will be chillin' and grillin' with me for the rest of my life.\",\n",
       " \"Great portable grill with a few caveats The Weber Smokey Joe is a great portable grill as far as cooking quality is concerned but there are a few issues.First the good. You get a decent size grill area for an ultra-portable grill. It measures at 14 1/2 inches in diameter. Sure you probably can't do much with this grill if you are cooking indirect, but that's not what this grill is meant for. The grill cooks much like it's larger cousin - the Weber One-Touch. The porcelain enamel coating helps prevent rust. There's a vent damper on the bottom of the grill (as well as the top) so it's quite easy to control your temperature, much better then any other portable grill I've owned anyways. The ash-catcher works well enough to keep hot pieces of ember from falling to the ground.As I mentioned before, there are a few caveats. My main complaint is that this grill has no lid-lock. This makes transportation a bit cumbersome, especially for a grill that is meant to be portable. You have to buy the Gold or Platinum version to get this functionality. I believe all portable grills should be easy to transport. I use a couple bungee cords to lock my lid down during transportation. Another small issue I had with mine is that one of the legs is a bit shorter then the other two, so my grill doesn't sit as evenly as it should. This isn't a big deal because Weber has great customer service, it's not that big of a deal anyways, it's just a little off. Finally the top grate doesn't fit very tightly so it wobbles around a bit - again a small issue. One other thing I should mention is that even though it has an ash catcher, it doesn't have any sort of One-Touch type of system, so you have to dump it to clean it (the vent damper doesn't quite do it).  This isn't an issue at all for me because it's very light and easy to clean anyways but I thought I would mention that for those that might be curious.All in all this is a great portable grill. For my wife and I this is a great grill to use even when we aren't going anywhere because it needs so little charcoal. Cooking on this grill definitely feels like I'm grilling on a baby version of my One-Touch. There are a few issues that keep this grill from getting a perfect score, but don't let these small issues keep you from buying this great grill. Personally I believe it's worth the $5.00 to go ahead and upgrade to the Gold so you can have the lid-lock, but it's not essential, like I said before a couple bungee cords do the trick if you need that functionality. Happy grilling!\",\n",

       " \"No power, no stove, Little Weber Grill kept us fed for a week !! Hurricane Irene was on its way and our gas grill was DOA. Thank goodness we have Amazon Prime, because I didn't think to order a grill until a few days before the storm; it arrived on Friday.  We lost power early Sunday morning and did not get it back until this Saturday.  There are only three of us, so this was just the right size for us -- you can fit three to four burgers on the grill at a time.  It was simple to put together and very easy to use -- just roll 4 or 5 sheets of newspaper loosely, place them in the bottom of the kettle, put in about 30 briquets in a pyramid shape, light the papers and the charcoal is ready to use in about 20 minutes.  Spread the charcoal out evenly  and place the grill in place and you are ready to go.  There's an instruction booklet included.  It was really a lifesaver this week and will be used regularly from now on.  It's easily portable for camping trips, too.\",\n",
       " \"OK for what it is Am writing this while cooking some chicken on a WSJ i found last week in new condition for a Hamilton. Let me preface my comments by stating that I have a 22-inch Weber with hinged grate that I love.The WSJ is small, somewhat solidly constructed (mine, while unused, has rust rings around the handle welds that go through the cover - not good).However, most folks use this Weber as a portable grill. Weber, for gawd's sakes, incorporate some form of simple mechanism ON ALL MODELS to keep the lid on in order to use the carry handle! (i use a pair of bungees looped every 45 degrees).The stove's best feature, the ability to cook using fewer coals, is also its drawback. This stove is best suited for slow cooking, delicate kebabs, fish, hot dogs, and burgers - not for hot, quick searing and grilling of thick steaks.Other drawbacks are the vents, which do not (at least on my unit) rotate smoothly. And trying to adjust the bottom vent to control air flow will result in your burning the beegeebees out of your fingers - i suggest fireproof mitts handling this stove.Also, being lightweight, this stove can dramatically shift during your cooking session, resulting in the potential for spillage of hot coals - especially if used on a light platform to increase cooking height (cooking on the ground with this thing can be down, but for many folks, may be uncomfortable). I'd suggest at least some holes for securing the stove legs to a platform or a way to weigh down the legs?All in all, this stove is OK - it gets the job done. I like Weber products, even if some of the QC and build quality has gone downhill in the last 10 years.I hope to enjoy my WSJ for as many years as my 18-inch (given away), my 22-inch (8 years going strong), and newest acquistion, the Smokey Joe Silver.\",\n",
       " \"Replacement for a 20 year old Smokey Joe You can tell these are quality grills; otherwise Weber wouldn't give these a 10 year warranty. My 20 year old Smokey Joe recently came to its demise and there was no doubt I'd purchase another. The only difference is they now have a nylon handle instead of a wooden handle. I keep mine outside on a patio 24/7/365 and it weathers the elements without covering it. I also use mine on an old metal wrought-iron table to make for safe grilling. This is the perfect size for 1-3 people.\",\n",
       " \"Love this grill Okay, I'm an addict and this is actually my fourth Weber grill...I buy one every four to five years, use it often, treat it poorly, and when it starts to show signs of age, I simply spring for a new one. Until I discovered the Weber, I seldom even got a year out of my grills - so this is quite an improvement for me. The quality of the product, and the results I get, are topnotch, and today, I wouldn't consider any other brand (except maybe a built-in Hastings - but that's another animal altogether).I go back and forth between the 22.5 inch and the 26 inch version. The 26 is more expensive, but it offers quite a bit more cooking area. It also uses quite a bit more charcoal, and to my eyes, it doesn't heat quite as evenly. Instead, I've settled on the 22.5, and on those relatively rare occasions when I need more grilling area, I just run a second grill.One thing I especially like is that Weber is so popular, you can get replacement parts just about anywhere. It's nice to know that if I open the grill in the Springtime and the grates are all rusty, I can zip over to the local hardware store and probably find an exact replacement.This time I went for the blue version, but otherwise it's the same Weber I've come to love. Easy to clean, rugged - and it cooks as well as anything out there. I'm not a fan of gas grills...they simply don't seem to get hot enough for certain uses. But with the Weber and some quality charcoal and you're all set, no matter what's on the menu.Only very small complaint is that I've had some problems with the paint peeling off under the top cover. In the past, once I noticed this happening, I simply scrubbed all the loose paint off with a wire brush...curious to see if this one has the same problem.Really recommended!\",\n",
       " 'Weber 22.5\" One-Touch Gold Kettle Grill - Awesome! I\\'m not even sure where to start!  I\\'ve wanted to add a charcoal grill to my outdoor cooking fleet for many years just for those few times that I\\'d like to cook more naturally.  I\\'ve used this one 2 times so far and can\\'t believe I\\'ve waited this long.  I think it\\'s saved me over $1000 I was going to spend to replace my 10 yr old gas grill.This grill and a couple Weber accessories make charcoal grilling a breeze!  I haven\\'t grilled with charcoal in years and obviously I had cheap junk for grills in the past.The quality of the grill is great, but I expected that.  I can see it lasting years and years as many others have attested to.  I\\'ll easily use it even during the week when I don\\'t have the time I thought it would take and thought gas was easier for.  The first use and trying to get used to charcoal again was almost a failure because I almost choked the heat down keeping the vents closed.  When I realized that the steaks slowed down cooking and the kettle top got wet from condensation it hit me that I had the vents closed thus the fire couldn\\'t breath.  All I had to do was open the vents and \\'viola, in no time the heat was back up and going strong with no other help from me, just air.Yesterday I outdid myself with ribs. Although I did cook them a little to high, they were the best I\\'ve ever done both falling off the bone and the best flavor I\\'ve ever gotten.  I was using Mesquite chips as well but I\\'ve done that on a gas grill and cooked twice as long and didn\\'t get near the same results.  It\\'s amazing how the kettle makes all the difference in the world keeping the charcoal hot and lasting a long time.  I\\'m amazed!Clean up is much easier than I expected.  The ash catcher is awesome, even in high gusty winds.  Access though the grill for adding fuel makes adding briquettes and wood a breeze.Assembly was easy and took less than 20 minutes taking my time.The only con I can come up with was that on the top handle, it came out of the undamaged box with a chip of the porcelain coming off as if it had been hit.  It\\'s small and by the handle and not exposing the metal so it\\'s not a functional problem but with the box arriving in perfect condition, it\\'s obvious it happened before being packed.  However, I\\'d be surprised if anyone could find it.All I can say is that I\\'m sold!!  Everything Weber that I\\'ve bought, from the grill to the accessories, have been top notch. Charcoal grilling is now a breeze and so much better than gas.  The old saying is absolutely true; having the right tools make all the difference in the world.  The Weber Kettle is absolutely the right tool!!  Being made in the USA is the cherry on top!To address some of the complaints in the lesser ratings:The handles don\\'t get hot.  As hot as mine has been, the handles are easy to hold with bare hands, although I tend to use a mitt around a grill.  The new handles should last in any weather condition and much longer than wood as well.It would be nice to have a temp gauge but that\\'s not hard to add if you really need one.  I can see the benefit but it\\'s limited.The Kettle is not unstable if it\\'s put together right.  If it falls apart after assembling, the legs aren\\'t being secured fully as they should be, which is to tap them all the way in.  Rolling it isn\\'t a problem but like with most anything, you have to be careful.  Depending on which way you roll it, one might be able to knock it over if not careful, but I\\'ve not found that to be easy to do.  Standing, it\\'s as stable as can be.  Again, if it\\'s wobbly or falls apart as one has claimed, the legs were not assembled properly.The lid DOES have a hook to hang on the side of the kettle; it\\'s on the underside of the top near the vent.  It hangs nicely on the side of the kettle.',\n",

Grilling outside is for leisure, take your time, relax and enjoy the flavor. So I opted for this Weber One Touch Gold - what I have been missing all these years!This grill is so easy to use. I didn't get the chimney starter, I just place some newspapers under the charcoal and it works just fine. I am usually grilling in about 15 - 20 minutes. The ash collector is fantastic, the ashes don't blow around and it makes it easy to remove the leftover ashes. I got blue, it really looks great.

The return for a replacement is painless and they order a new one for me right away. All I need to do is put the damaged grill in the original box, re-tape it, leave it outside my front door. UPS was here the next day, pick up the box and return to Amazon. That was really easy.I finally receive my new blue grill today. It is perfect and only took me 10 minutes to assemble it. The ash tray needs a little adjustment with a plier and now it is working perfectly. I have ordered a work table and putting it in is a snap.  I also got the smokenator and it fit perfectly inside the grill. Try the cover and it fit perfectly and no gap in between with everything in place. I am a happy camper and ready to do some bbq this weekend.  The blue color looks really nice in my backyard for an extra $10.So do not get despair if you get a defect, just keep returning and you will eventually get a perfect one. It worth the wait.I am glad that I only need to return it one time. On my reasons of return, I mention this grill is defective and should not put back on the shelve and send to other customers. I also contact Weber and let them know about this so they can improve their product quality control in the future before boxing their products and send to the distributor.Hope this help and good luck.',\n",
       " \"Let me Explain We ordered this for the FIRST time on February 5, 2010.  My husband was so excited and rushed out to buy charcoal, cleaning brushes, etc.  When we got it and he opened the box we discovered one of the handles was bent, and there was a large section that had no protective paint over it, making us fear it would rust prematurely.  Needless to say we were disappointed.  He boxed it up and I called Amazon, and they were great!  They immediately sent us a return packaging slip, and placed a new order (at upgraded two day shipping no less) for us.  So, once we got all that straightened out and got the second one (which looked great by the way) we unpacked it and looked forward to making the chicken we had prepared.My husband put it together and brought it over to me and I must say, the blue looks a heck of a lot cooler than the basic black!  This is the upgraded model with the reservoir for ashes, and while I don't do a lot of grilling, my husband really appreciated this aspect of the grill.It was easy to put together, and Weber has a wonderful reputation when it comes to grill products.  The chicken we cooked on it came out wonderfully, though we have had a gas grill for the past few years, so the extra time a charcoal grill takes will take some time to get used to.All in all well worth the money.//Update March 2013: Wow. Has it already been over 3 years? I guess it has. This grill is still going strong. We clean it regularly, and keep it covered with one of the standard Weber grill covers. It has no rust and still cooks some great food. The ash catch is an absolute must have with the charcoal grills. Still very pleased with this purchase. Especially seeing as we've had other grills fall apart in little over a year.\",\n",
       " \"Used for several years I love BBQ. For convenience I have often used a gas grill, but really do love the taste of meat cooked over charcoal (PAH and NCA risks notwithstanding). I have often cooked turkey breasts for Thanksgiving, and particularly love the smokey flavor that comes with it! Alongside baked potatoes and fresh veggies (extra nice on the grill), I have a special meal that is actually healthy.So when my last gas grill bit the dust, we went back to the old fashioned way of cooking! Real charcoal, real delicious smell, real delicious flavor! I suggest that you consider using theWeber 7416 Rapidfire Chimney Starter, so that you can have the purest taste without any chemical oders.A funny thing happened when a dear friend came by to visit ... Her son was entranced by the fact that we didn't have any fuel for our BBQ.  Times change, but old fashioned flavor doesn't. This grill made  the move with us recently and now sits on our new deck waiting for spring, or at least a nice sunny day!\",\n",
       " 'Weber One-Touch Gold Charcoal Grill, Black Great Product! Makes it fun and easy to Bar-B-Que.I have a Weber Gas Grill and use it all the time. However when I want that real charcoal flavor nothing beats this Weber Grill. The ashes just fall into the bottom for easy removal.A great product and reasonably priced.',\n",
       " '\"one touch clean up\" - not quite the grill is fine, but what i was really hoping was the clean up of the ashes was actually \"one touch\".  perhaps you can get used to it, but removing and re-attaching the ash-catcher is a bit of a pain.  there are much better ways to design an ash catcher that would be easy to remove and re-attach. oh well...hopefully weber will spend some money on a re-design for the ash catcher in future models.',\n",
       " 'Love this grill! This is my second Weber...the first lasting me about 7 years. We like charcoal (instead of gas) and the Weber is a wonderful all-around grill.',\n",
       " 'Hard to beat When it came time for us to get a new charcoal grill I searched every site and checked out dozens of different grills, some costing many hundreds of dollars, all promising some advantage.Some units were really interesting, and not too expensive, but upon close inspection many of these proved to be tinny and cheaply made. The very expensive systems were very nice, but did not offer rotisseries and other useful accessories and were just too expensive for us anyway.So, we ended up with another Weber, the Gold Model. In the many years since our last Weber, there have been a lot of improvements that kept it attractive. The ash catcher really does make cleanup much easier and the vent system is more functional. The grill itself has the new flip-up hatches that allow you to add more coals and move them around without having to lift up the grill. I did that all the time with the old grill.The optional little bent-wire style of charcoal retainers do help to keep the coals out to the side when you want to use a drip pan in the center.Others have recommended the chimney style charcoal start for ecological reasons. It is also just plain faster to use as well, and it is made of heavy gauge metal that is both attractive and long-lasting.I love the optional rotisserie (see those reviews) and it comes with an extension ring that is also useful for other cooking options.We got the green colored kettle and it looks very nice on the patio. The general design and those odd white-wall tires give it a kind of vintage look.This is a well-made and very functional grill with all sorts of interesting available accessories that really work well. There is a reason for the popularity of the Weber. I looked, I bought. Hard to beat................Update 7/2012. Still good, used daily all summer and even in the rain under my porch cover. Something I came up with that could be interesting to the more dedicated user. I essentially bought a downed oak tree and have been splitting it for firewood for next winter. Had a lot of small, crooked, knotty, twisted pieces that couldn\\'t easily be split. I cut them up into 1\" cubes on a band saw, hoping to use them as briquettes in the Weber. A newspaper sprinkled with cooking oil got them started in the Weber chimney starter quite quickly. The secret is to be a bit patient so that they stop flaming and turn to glowing coals. And then you have a genuine oak BBQ, just like on a ranch. Very good, but a lot of work and dangerous enough even on a band saw. And it messes up the blade and rollers. The other more accessible method would be to simply start an oak campfire in the Weber, using regular old pieces of oak like you would in a fireplace. It would take some time to burn down to coals, but even more of an excuse to drink too much and then burn the food because....well, everyone has done this. Right? Anyway, flaming oak imparts a kind of bitter taste while glowing oak coals make it delicious. I do this research for you.__________________________Update 2, on cooking an expensive steak. This works and requires no skill. I went out and bought the most expensive steak ever, an organic, grass fed, free range whatever ribeye at a boutique market and the attractive butcher girl probably had her thumb on the digital scale besides. I about died when I saw the price. Hmmm, can\\'t afford to cook this any way but perfectly.I once saw a YouTube video on how to properly cook a steak using high heat and this is my BBQ grill interpretation of that.Use the coal retainers to block off a section of the lower grill and fill up that smaller portion with lots of hot coals. It cannot be too hot in this case.Put on the cooking grill and let the previous session\\'s grease flame off, which of course also heats it up hotly and is somewhat entertaining and makes you feel guilty about what you are eating...Put on the steak. Having those long tongs helps a lot. You can rub it with olive oil if you want, but it is unclear to me if that is necessary and it causes more flame-ups. No BBQ sauce though. Lid off! Deal with the flame-ups by maneuvering the steak around. Some people use a water spray. This is hands-on, attentive work.Stand by. It will cook fast. Have your other food well under way. Within minutes the down side will have that crust of goodness, short of burnt of course. Turn it over and do the other side. When that side is seared, remove the steak and insert a digital cooking thermometer, taking care to place it in the very center, from the side (not stabbed in from the top).  I use a Polder and the line from the sensor to the display seems to hold up in high heat, but don\\'t string it out over the coals. Run it out the back. Set the alarm for 130.Put the steak back over the un-coaled area. The effect now is that this is a very hot oven, not a grill. Put on the lid, make sure all vents are open. Watch the temp rise, amazingly fast so don\\'t wander off.Remove the steak, with tongs, to a plate and cover it with aluminum foil, resting it as they say on cooking shows. By the time everything else is served up, maybe 10 minutes or so, it should be ready to serve.This gives you a steak that looks exactly like the ones in advertisements, medium rare with a great crust.  You can throw it back on and in a couple of minutes the temp and doneness will go up. There is no shame in putting food back on the fire, but there is shame in over-cooking it! If you paid the big bucks for your meat, burning it will make you cry.BTW, this works for other meat like thick cut pork chops (thick ones are easier to cook properly). Use the same method, but run the temp up to 140-145 (145 being the new govt standard, and in fact it is the standard for all meat other than poultry. If you were brought up on thin, over-cooked pork chops (we all were) you have a revelation coming. Chicken parts don\\'t require the high heat, but a quick sear and off the the oven part works very well for them.It is suggested that the steak be served with salt and pepper, applied after it is cooked as it may be a bad idea to subject the salt and pepper to high heat. The more expensive the meat, the less you should put on it. Cooks always suggest kosher salt and it is indeed very good for this, and ground pepper is better as well. I really think BBQ sauce is too much for expensive beef, but if you want to fancy it up, slowly heat up some butter and garlic and let it meld together. Strain it and serve it on the side, or simply pour it on. What the heck, you have already gone well over the fat grams or whatever for the month anyway...If you have to cook more than maybe 3 or 4 large steaks, you could fill the entire bowl with coals and then finalize them in the kitchen oven set very high, like 450, and with the temp probe stuck in the most representative steak. This gives you 90% of the grilling experience and taste.',\n",
       " 'The best charcoal grill available, 12 years and counting... I have used a number of different charcoal grills, and the Weber Gold is the best.  Unless you want to spend twice the price and buy the Weber Performer, which is a Weber Gold with gas ignition, table, and a place to store charcoal. Not sure why you would want to store charcoal outside where it can absorb moisture, but that is another story.First off the Weber is made with a thicker steel, so it retains the heat better than the cheaper, lighter, offshore made products.  The grill is heavier, so you can get more than one season out of it.  The ash catcher is great.  Its a must have feature.  Other units get ashes all over my deck, which is unacceptable, and a fire hazard on windy days.My Weber Gold is about 10 years old.  I replaced the cooking grate once.  It still functions perfectly.  It lives outside and only has one tiny spot of rust, where the cover got hit with a rock and it chipped the paint.  One day I will get around to sanding and painting that spot so it lasts another 10 years.  The aluminum portions of the grill are a little weathered, but still function perfectly.  I guess if I really wanted to I could polish them up, but a little oxidation does not bother me.The only downside I can even think about is the top handle.  It is plastic, not wood.  Sometimes it gets too hot to handle so I have to use a potholder if I am cooking at a very high temperature.  Other than that, it is the best charcoal grill on the planet.Sure you can buy one cheaper, but they will not last.  Buy a Weber and you will leave it to your children when you die.  And they will get many years of use out of it too!',\n",

Installation of the grill was fairly easy even for me. We had three families of visitors when we tried it the 1st time, we cooked a lot of meat, pepper, corn and etc, it was awesome.

The 3rd leg kind of twirls on which is quite obvious once you start fiddling with it but the instructions have no words so the pictures are not as self-explaintory as I would have hoped in these 2 areas.My only complaints on this grill are the legs and the handle. The legs were wobbly and not as secure as I would have liked them and they were installed all the way to the base of the grill (as the picture showed)  some nuts and bolts would have went far in this area.The handle gets to hot to handle with bare hands. especially when doing large meats like roasts or whole chickens. Wood would have fixed this problem. I wrapped mine with some small rope (not string) and it helped a little.All said and done it's a great grill.

By using the vents you can get wood chips to smolder for an hour and not flare up and burn away in minutes.  The ash pan holds at least three cooks worth of ashes and does not leak.

       " \"What a piece of junk! :) That title was sarcasm, in case you missed it.When we bought a house almost fourteen years ago, I brought along a Weber Smokey Joe grill I had used when I was single.  We used it for the first several months of our marriage as our only grill.  Then we bought a Weber 22 1/2 inch kettle grill for our new backyard.  We have used it regularly ever since.  It works for indirect cooking of roasts and chickens, it works for direct grilling burgers, chops and sausages, it works for roasting chiles and it works as a fire pit to burn hardwood logs to fuel my large offset firebox smoker.  This grill has been out in the weather without a cover for 13 years or so and it has held up beyond reasonable expectations.  Only within the past few months has the use, age and abuse begun to take a toll.  There are several spots where the porcelain has worn away that are rusting through or already have rusted through.  The wooden handles dry rotted away.  The nuts holding the aluminum airflow disc adjusters at the bottom of the kettle rusted off.  And I'm still using it.  I did a steak and some pork chops last night, using lump charcoal and pecan hardwood chunks I chopped up myself.  They were delicious.I also have a gas grill that is convenient but does not even come close to giving the good taste you can get from charcoal and wood fuel.  Trying to use a smoker box on a gas grill is futile for me.  You can't adjust the airflow through a gas grill.  The only adjustment is the level of the flame.  I constantly find the wood chips either just burn up quickly without producing much smoke or they never heat up enough to start smoking at all.  The gas grill doesn't get much use at my house.I also use an offset firebox smoker.  It's great for doing large size pieces of meat or poultry or multiple pieces of smaller items.  It does require frequent attention to keep the fire going and the temperature within the proper range.  Honestly, the Weber grills can do the same or better job for smaller cuts of meat by cooking indirect.  About the only time I use the smoker is when I have something too large for the Weber.It's time retire the old Weber.  I've already put a One-Touch Gold on my Amazon wishlist.  I think I'll use the old grill as a planter.  I can't imagine throwing it away after all these years.\",\n",

But I can\\'t say it\\'s really ever bothered me ALL that much! You\\'ll want to use a charcoal chimney to light your coals -- I used to build a little fire with newspaper and sticks but the charcoal chimney is the way to go, and one chimney will nicely fill the coal area on the Silver Kettle Grill. Do not ever use lighter fluid or fuel-soaked coals.

Well folks, it's worth it.  I had to get a covered grill that wasn't as big as my car for the front porch, after all the hollering by neighbors who saw the smoke billowing from my hibachi.  After all the charcoal experimenting with my barrel grill and its cousins and a Bodum  Fyrkat, I figured, what's new?  Well, a whole lot.  While related to the Bodum, the Weber is a whole lot more versatile, and can, if you wish create a range of flavors and textures.  While the one-touch system was touted as a handy cleaning device, where it really excells is as a controllable oxygen source.  Couple that nicety with movement of the 4-hole vent in the lid and  you control both the intensity of the heated charcoals with directionality.  When you're using indirect heat, the control of the temps lay with the oxygen adjustment, whilst the direction of the heat can determine the moistness as well as the degree of charring of the food.  The heavy steel as well as the brilliantly designed cooking grate that facilitates access to the coals make for a fun time at the cookery.  The Weber is iconic; it deserves that status.\",\n",

I love the one touch clean out on the bottom of the grill, that is also the vent cover.  The old kettles had a bottom vent that was just like the vent on top.  That little tab would get warmer than you want to touch with your bare fingers.  The new one has a handle that doesn't get too hot to handle.  The vents open easily, and move around the ashes in the bottom, and push them out the vent holes.Just one little piece of advice.  When you are installing the legs, pay attention to which leg goes where.  The one that is different goes in the hole right under the handle.  I hasve both seen and owned grills that have the wrong leg in the wrong hole, and that makes the handle on the side, intstead of the front.

For an extra 50 bucks you can get an upgraded model that has an enclosed ash/ember containment system. If you live in areas prone to dryness or wildfires, you could be taking a big chance with this unsafe grill. I love the way a Weber cooks, but this model is needlessly risky.  And if you have one of these grills,  take precautions like putting a metal bucket under this grill. A paint can works nicely and you can buy clean empty paint cans at Lowes. This will help reduce the fire risk and will keep ash from blowing around wildly.....it also makes getting rid of ash an easy task.

       " 'Great multi-function cooker I had a Weber Kettle grill 20 years ago.  I had no clue what I was doing, but I still got great results.  Open the vents, put on the dome, and a little while later I had great food.  But I got tired of waiting for charcoal to heat up, and went on to propane.  I never got good results with gas.  After wasting way too many years destroying food on gas grills, I came home to charcoal and Weber.  This time around I know what I\\'m doing, and the Weber is giving me Fantastic results.  The 22 1/2 kettle is a great all around cooker.  It grills, sears, bakes and does a very good job of \"low and slow\" smoking.  If you only have the room or desire for one cooker, get this one without hesitation.  It won\\'t smoke quite as good as a real smoker, but unless you\\'re a perfectionist, you\\'ll never know the differance.  The 18 inch grill is a great cooker too, but because it\\'s smaller it\\'s harder to smoke on it.  So if you have the room, get this model.  The lid and bowls are built like a tank.  I found the unit wiggles around where the legs attach, even though I assembled it correctly.  The older ones don\\'t wiggle.  But that\\'s progress.  I don\\'t think it\\'s a problem though, just an observation.  I was torn between 4-5 stars because of that.

       " 'An honest review (UPDATE) Alright,I am one that loves to grill, but doesn\\'t know anything about grills themselves, really. Due to monetary situations I had to grill on the cheapest possible grill... The green Sunbeam camper grill. I\\'m sure you know what grill I\\'m talkin\\' about. For over 6 years it has been my grill of choice (hey it was only $10!) and has treated me well. Over these years I always dreamed about owning a \"real\" charcoal grill. I wanted the American icon, I wanted the Weber One-Touch. I heard all about how durable and well built it was, how it will last for 10 years+ and how it\\'s just a step above the rest. After actually purchasing this grill I have a bit of buyers remorse. You see, before actually buying this I was looking at a grill from Char-Broil. It had the ash catching pan like the One-Touch gold, it had space to put plates and such (sorta like the One-Touch Platinum) and it had grates with adjustable height, not to mention all of this came at a price just $5 higher then the One-Touch Silver! Anyways, for the last 2 years I wanted nothing more then the Weber so I got it. Once I started puting it together I realized that this grill just doesn\\'t seem to have $80 worth of craftsmanship. The legs are super-flimsy hollow aluminum pipes, very cheap. The itsy bitsy tabs that hold the bottom grate are slightly uneven so my bottom grate is a bit wobbly (also it\\'s possible for the bottom grate to fall because the tabs are pretty small). A wobbly bottom grate probably doesn\\'t make a lick of difference when it comes to grilling, it\\'s just that it wasn\\'t right, it\\'s just one of those little annoying quirks. I guess I expected everything to be heavy duty. I expected solid metal legs and such. You can find an identical grill from Char-Broil for less then half the cost! I hear that Weber is a step above because they are built to last... well my cheap $10 Sunbeam is 6+ years old and I\\'ve never had any problems with it, it\\'s all about how you take care of it. Personally, I think for the $80 price tag of the One-Touch silver, you should at least get the hinged cooking grate, but you don\\'t.There are good things however. First, it\\'s just nice to have the American icon. There is a certain feeling that comes with grillin\\' on the good ol\\' Weber kettle. There are a TON of accessories made for it and replacement parts are extremely easy to find. The one-touch system is pretty handy (although hardly one-touch).Overall I am still happy with the purchase, I love looking at that grill. It\\'s probably gonna grown on me more and more as years pass by. Based on price I decided to get the Silver version, but the Gold might be worth looking at. Afterall you get a much better ash-pan (I modified my silver to be just as good though... just a little creativity should do the trick) and you get the hinged grate with the gold (although you can just buy this grate for $15-$20 and stick it on your Silver if you wanna)Choose... but choose wisely.YEAR UPDATE-----------------------------------------------------Okay, now it\\'s been over a year since I posted my original review. This really is a great grill, I wish I could bump the stars up to 4, but I can\\'t... Amazon wont let me. Some of the minor quams I said previously still apply, but this baby cooks a mean dish! I have abused mine for a year and it runs like brand new.What really made me do this update was when I grilled on a buddy\\'s kettle. It wasn\\'t a weber kettle and it shows. After a year of using this I got to know this grill really well, I got used to such high quality materials. This grill really is above and beyond most other kettle style grills.I do wish I would have purchased the gold though. The ash pan that comes with the silver is not much use if you\\'re grilling in any sort of wind.',\n",

       " \"Quality Is Suffering But Nothing Better Out There First the good. I love the looks of this grill. It is sleek, styling and iconic and I enjoy seeing it on my porch.- It is much more attractive than one of those monstrous gas grills.- It seals very tightly.- Its simple style allows you to cook many different meats in many different ways.- There are so many accessories available for it and they are easy to find.Now the bad. Besides the black metal kettle part, everything else seems to be of terribly cheap quality and not what I would expect in this price range.- The legs and bottom frame are made of shockingly thin and weak metal. I wouldn't buy my kids toys with such cheap trashy metal.- The wheels are made of cheap hard hollow one-sided plastic. Again, I would not buy a children's toy with such cheap wheels.- The side handle melted during the first use when we hung the lid from it while cooking.Let's face it. This is a lot of money for a basic charcoal grill. You are paying for quality and looks. I gave it four stars only on the merit that there simply isn't a viable competitor right now. If there were other options it would not have fared so well. I feel like Weber has taken advantage of their good name and market share and is allowing their quality to suffer.Shockingly, I would buy it again.\",\n",

However, anyone shopping for a grill should consider the full-size, 22.5 grill.We bought the 18.5 because our family is small and I figured this would be plenty big enough. What I didn\\'t consider was that a larger grill will give you lots of additional options for indirect cooking and smoking. The 18.5 just doesn\\'t have the space, even for a small family. If you only want to cook burgers and hot dogs for 3 to 4 people, the 18.5 will serve fine but you won\\'t have much versatility.Now that I\\'ve \"grown\" as a griller, I wish I had the One-touch Platinum. This model gives extra space, an ash catcher, temp gauge, sliding lid and 2 side tables. However, my 18.5 is still going strong after 5 years of steady use and sitting in the elements. Kinda difficult to justify the new grill when the old one is still in great shape.',\n",

I love my Charcoal grill especially for those times when I want Steak, Burgers, Chicken, BBQ Chicken, for a great authentic taste. It heats quickly (Weber Chimney) about 20 minutes. It is easy to assemble, very sturdy and quite stable. Some reviewers noted they could not move with hot coals and food as it only has one handle. You should never move a hot grill of any kind. It should be used in a safe place away from combustable materials. The Weber Silver Kettle Grill is terrific and I use it almost regularly and in combination with my gas grill for a complete cooking experience outdoors. (I also have a smoker for the real low and slow cooking). The 18 1/2 inch cooking surface is excellent, and 2 zone and 3 zone is possible by adjusting the number of coals used and position.

My locale allows year round trapping and disposal.  Bear in mind, some areas do not allow transfer of animals from one location to another to limit spread of disease.SetupDepending upon what you're trying to catch, you place the appropriate bait distal to the lever in the compartment of trap.  I am catching raccoons, and they enjoy, fish, crispy bacon, nuts and marshmallows.  The trap is a little tricky to set up.  Lift the metal gate and secure a small latch that connects to a slot in the door.I have a recommendation with regards to placement.  Because the floor is open, I recommend placing this on a piece of cement or plywood.  It will keep you from having to dig out a lot of dirt, which I have done.The trap is durable and will keep your critter secure.ConclusionI caught my first raccoon on the first night.

The trap is well constructed and holds up to heavy abuse by the trapped animals. The only reason I gave it 4/5 is that it takes two hands to open the trap. If I ever catch a skunk I am going to be in for a stinky experience. It would be nice if this trap had a quick release mechanism that could be operated from a little distance and a long pole of some sort.',\n",
       " \"Fix the Handle and Top Shield I caught five raccoons in six days of having the trap set. Sometimes the raccoon turns the trap over after he is trapped but it doesn't open. The carrying handle and shield came off with the second raccoon. I used a needle-nose pliers to wrap the shield flange around the wires of the trap and now it stays on securely. I also used the pliers to tighten the wires that hold the carrying handle on. Subsonic .22 caliber bullets can humanely eliminate the raccoon without a lot of noise. Marshmallows make good bait. Something fishy will catch raccoons but it can also catch cats and opossums, which I am not trying to reduce.\",\n",
       " \"Tips for Squirrel Catching- 4 squirrels in 4 days! I did not have to make any adjustments either to the trigger or trigger arm.  Just be sure the cage is completely level and the trigger arm nor the door is rubbing up against anything to obstruct or slow down the releasing of the trap door.However, ground squirrels are clever little critters.  Most times you come out and see the door sprung and the food gone is because they tried getting the food out the other end of the cage through the wire - and they can do that.  I cut a piece of OSB to completely cover the other end of the outside of the cage and tied it on with wire. The first time I used heavy cardboard - they ripped it to shreds to get to the food. Then all you have to do is upend the cage - drop something covered with peanut butter in (I use graham crackers)- it will stick to the wire and OSB (also slowing down the squirrel just enough to trip the pan).  Use a little stick if you have to, to mash it to the wire and OSB.  Another good bait are apple strips.  These are made with apple peelers that have the little crank.  The whole apple peel comes off in one strip.  This also slows down the squirrel and the apple peel will cover part of the pan.  Bigger items like this are more successful than small ones.It was more work taking the critters away and releasing them that catching them.This is a perfect size to catch ground squirrels - the size down is a bit small - this one has more room they have to cover to trip the pan - in other words they can't just dangle half their body in, grab the food and leave without getting near the pan.\",\n",

If I had hired a &#34;critter getter&#34; to trap them, they would have killed them which I didn't want.Easy to set, easy to pick up without exposing yourself to the animal inside.  I like the way it opens, I cover the trap with a towel so they can't see me and just pop the door up.  The minute they see the opening, they are gone.If you are going to transport them remember that it is against the law in some areas.

Over the summer, I was constantly noticing piled mulch in my beds and every time I would go to flatten it back out I would find a cat poop covered up; not only a pain to clean up but also a health hazard too.  After checking the security tapes I found it was a feral cat problem we had.  I found this trap on Amazon and saw a good majority of the reviews were favorable and decided to give it a try.  Setup out of the box was a little confusing at first but the kit is mostly assembled out of the box.  The only parts you have to assemble are the pole from the step that triggers the door to a hook on the door and to secure the back of the cage closed.  It was a bit of a challenge to get the pole from the step to the door to line up but it seemed so simple after getting it together.This trap is very durable.  Solidly constructed, pre-assembly out of the box was a positive.  The first night I set up the trap with a small paper plate of a little bit of wet cat food.  I checked on the trap after a couple hours and had caught my first feral cat.  I transferred it to a different cage to take to the shelter the next day and set the trap up again.  All told over about a week I had caught nearly 8 feral cats, I couldn't believe there were that many in my neighborhood.  What is great about this trap is the assembly of the door, easy to open and release the animal should you be looking to relocate an animal such as opossum's or groundhogs.  The best thing you can do is to cover the trap with an old towel.  Not only will it help protect you from clawing animals but I found that it helped to calm the animal and also kept the trapped animal from giving away what the trap really is to other animals.For the price, this is a really durable animal trap and I have been satisfied to own it.  I've even lent it to a few friends and they have told me they had great results capturing their troublesome creatures of the night.  The best part is the unit can be easily broken down to store flat against the wall, and can pop back together quite quickly when you need it.\",\n",

       " \"Absolute best mouse trap if you don't like spring traps We get a lot of mice when the weather turns cold.  I've tried every type of mouse trap on the market, including spring traps, repeating traps, electronic traps, etc.  The old-fashioned spring traps are the best and cheapest solution, but they can be a bit gruesome.  This tin cat trap is the most reliable alternative I've found.  When I hear, see, or smell mice, I put this out and invariably end up finding mice in it the next morning.  The first tin cat that I bought almost 20 years ago is still catching mice.A few important notes:- This is only a live catch mouse trap if you check it daily.  You can't expect to catch mice, leave them in the trap for a week, and expect to find live critters the next weekend.  If they die in the trap, you'll face a smelly clean up task.- I noticed a lot of reviews from people who said the trap stopped working.  In my experience, this is almost always because something has gotten wedged under the trap-door ramp.  Often it seems to be because the mice crawl into the semi-enclosed trap door spaces to die if you don't empty the trap in time.  If the trap is outdoors, twigs and bits of sand can blow up the trap-door ramps and keep them from working.  95% of the time, just banging the trap on the ground a few times dislodges whatever is in the way.  About 2-3 times a year, I spray off the inside of the trap with a garden hose, which seems to clean out remaining debris just fine.In a nutshell:  This is a great trap design that consistently catches mice and has worked for me for decades.  In my experience, the trap has proven to be very reliable and durable with an occasional bit of cleaning.\",\n",

       " \"Success In Five Hours Update June 3, 2011More mole activity which has now been stopped by a Victor trap. This time the activity was in the back yard including a flower bed. I decided to skip the test pressing phase and just selected a mole run, pressed the soil down and placed the trap. Sure enough the next day I had a dead mole in the trap. I had set two traps and the second one didn't catch anything so they are both back in the garage waiting for the next mole trapping adventure.Original reviewFive hours after I set two traps I had trapped a mole; I was truly surprised to see one trap sprung and at first thought it must have accidently tripped; I pulled the trap out of the ground and there was a dead mole, the trap had done its job perfectly.I had lived at my house for over 30 years and this mole infestation was a first. When I started seeing the raised soil trails and dead grass I suspected I had somehow gotten a mole in my yard. I started reading everything I could find on the web and started getting free advice from friends.I called the pest service we use and the man suggested I buy the Victor trap as that was the one they used and the cost of them coming out and setting the traps could get very expensive. I read the Amazon reviews on the trap and they were generally helpful so I decided to buy the Victor traps.The general advice was to locate active runs by pressing down the soil that had been displaced by the mole which I did and then followed up with a hose to really flatten them down. Sure enough the following day certain trails had been raised up again and I selected one of those to place the traps.My yard has a sandy soil mixed with clay; it is also rather root infested so I followed several recommendations which said it was important to cut away any roots that might hinder the traps free movement. Before I placed the trap that caught the mole; I used a straight edged steel edger and pressed it down into the soil where the trap would be placed; sure enough I had to cut through several roots that crossed that area. I used my foot to press down the raised area where the trap would be placed.It took a little experimentation to finally get the trap set; I had never set a trap before so this was all new to me. It does take some pressure to set the trap; there is a safety latch which can be engaged first but then additional pressure with the tools provided is needed to actually set the trigger.I left the safety latch in place until the trap was set in the ground and I had pressed it down so the trigger was resting on the soil. Once that was all done I released the safety latch and the trap was ready.I covered the trap with a garden pot to keep the area dark and protect it from being disturbed by local cats and dogs. This was all done late yesterday morning and by mid afternoon it had trapped a mole.I will update this review if anything of interest happens. In the meantime both traps are in place waiting for the next mole.\",\n",
       " 'The trap works if you DO NOT FOLLOW DIRECTIONS This type of trap is highly effective IF you do NOT follow the directions about how to place it. If you bury it (which the directions will tell you to do) it will simply NOT work. If your \"out o sight\" trap is out of sight it is TOO DEEP and all you will get is holes in your yard and perhaps an annoyed mole.When the very expensive exterminator (who we now refer to as \"Mark the Mole Man\") came to our house, I showed him our \"out of sight\" mole trap. He tried to be respectful but finally just said, \"Ma\\'am, that\\'s too deep. Ain\\'t gonna kill nothin\\'.\" As it turns out, this is exactly the same type of trap he uses. He just knows how to use it correctly.He pulled it up and knocked the dirt off and walked around the yard for a while telling me stuff about moles. He clearly took great pride in his mole murdering skills (please don\\'t give PETA my address.) Finally he stopped, stood silently for a moment, then he stepped his boot gently on a run until the soil was level with the surrounding soil. Next he took his special tool for making the slits that the previous reviewer described making with a shovel, and he made his two slits in the run for the blades to fit into.Then, artist that he was, Mark the Mole Man pressed the trap blades slowly into the slits he had made until the flat trigger was sitting gently on the soil. Released the safety and - Done. He placed three more in the back yard (BIG yard) and 24 hours later we had a dead mole.It was a wonderful (and for us expensive) experience.

It also leaves a wiggling tempting snack for other animals to eat, who then take the mouse AND trap to locations unknown. Trap is not selective and will kill or injure anything that trips it. The most selective and humane way to trap is to use a Havahart trap, then euthanize only the problem animals with ether (found as \"starting fluid\" in automotive stores). Ether is a potent anesthetic which was used on humans in early medical procedures. It\\'s also extremely flammable so take great care.',\n",

I think I've tried every deterrent out there--sticky boards, poisons, quick-set and traditional traps.  Like outdoor chipmunks, these mice are clever.  Poison blocks don't seem to interest them, and they know how to side-step sticky boards.So far, I have had the best luck with these cheaply made plastic Victor traps.  I bought two types of quick-set traps--these Victor ones andSnap-E Mouse Trap by Kness(based that purchase on popular reviews).  Even though Victor's snap isn't very strong, it does indeed kill mice.  I have yet to catch anything with the Kness traps.  They have a stronger snap, but so far all I've come up with are sprung, empty traps.  The same bait is used for both traps (peanut butter).I don't care how mice are caught, as long as the job gets done.  This season, Victor Quick Set mouse traps are proven winners.  I don't think they'll last a long time, but they certainly outperform sticky boards and are easier to set than the old-fashioned method.\",\n",

I can not, physically it is impossible for me to open an old board/metal mouse trap. I know, weird, but it just freaks me out! So, I got these and was so excited! We keep our dog food in the garage and pet food draws mice. Every spring/fall we get them in the food or the garage itself. So I tried these traps. Lots of them. I go for total overkill (pun intended) when it comes to killing anything lower than my ankles! Well, these do NOT kill anything. They spent weeks with nothing in them. But the old mouse traps (my hubby sets them) had about one every few days. He just reset his and laughed at my 'old lady' traps. Sigh. I know these look great, and they are super easy to use, but they will not kill anything. I have now read the other reviews and have no idea how anyone could give these a positive review. Also, the thought of having a LIVE mouse to deal with? What a gross, awful, torturous hassle. No thanks. Hope this helps!\",\n",
       " \"a tale of sad success Having been unable to create a method of capturing marauding mice and teleporting them unharmed to another galaxy, I resorted to a humane trap, intending to drive them several miles into the county and release them to find their county mouse cousins.  Alas and alack, the mice were able to enter the humane traps, retrieve the bait (peanut butter on a bit of cracker) and exit the traps with the bait.  Perhaps they work in pairs with one holding the door open while the other goes in for the food. With a heavy heart I next purchased a pair of these traps. For many nights the mice could count on their evening meal, the bait strategically placed in various places in this trap. They walzed in, dined, and left, no doubt laughing their little tails off.  It seems a human with a master's degree in psychology is no match for the average rodent.  Then, wonder of wonders, last night the traps actually lured two hapless diners to their death. My delight was short lived upon reading reviews here that the mice do not die instantly, but might suffer for a time before expiring. What's a person to do?  My advice, if you do purchase this type trap, is to use just the smallest amount of bait (my successful last night bait was cream cheese) which I rubbed the entire length of the pressure activated metal strip. I think previously I was using too large a piece of cheese or cream cheese. I suppose I'll continue to use the traps, as I have to get this problem resolved though it's awful to think of them suffering at all.\",\n",

The refills are easy to use, they come with a separate protective layer for each refill and it's fairly convenient to use the protective layer to cover the old, flea infested sticky trap when replacing it with a new refill.  Happy with the refills and the way they are packaged and installed.For the trap itself:I have 2 of these for 2 different locations.  Four stars instead of five because they do trap fleas; but they won't arrest an infestation. I use them as an indicator of the severity of the problem and whether I'm getting it under control.  Fleas are hard to see and find on carpet and furniture, not so tough to find on the dogs.The traps work best at night, don't seem to do much of anything during the day.  If I think I might have a problem or know the dogs have fleas I get the traps out.  This year we were successful with Siphotrol spray on the carpet and furniture and Barklogic's Lemongrass shampoo on the dogs (separate reveiws for those).  I count the fleas in the flea traps on a daily basis so I can tell that those measures are being effective, and when the overnight catch count goes to zero that's a good indicator the fleas are gone.If you are hoping the flea trap will cure an infestation by itself, there's a good chance you'll be disappointed. It might work, but I wasn't willing to wait that long.\",\n",
       " \"Catches More Than Fleas I first started using theVictor Ultimate Flea Trapwhen I lived in California because we had a problem with sand fleas coming in our back patio screen door. We also didn't want to use any pesticides, since we had four small house pets.When we moved to Michigan, we continued using the traps because our child was born, and we felt even more strongly about avoiding pesticides. Although we did not have a flea problem, the traps have caught several types of spiders, the occasional house fly, a few random creepy crawlies, and even a hornet! Basically, they seem to trap anything attracted to the light/heat.We keep them tucked away, out of sight (ex: in a back corner of our furnace room, under furniture), and in places where the pets can't get too curious -- getting a refill stuck to your skin (or dog fur) is the absolute worse.All in all, I think we've been using these traps for nearly ten years now.

The only way to do this is either aerate or remove the thatch, which I chose the thatching rake.  I worked my butt off for about 2 hours and had gotten only about 20% of my yard complete, if that.  Not sure if it's supposed to do this, but the head would swivel over about 2-4 rakings, and you will have to flip it over, to get the preferred angle.

Each of the patterns is distinct in its function and useful and something about the design allows great water pressure where you need it even if you have a well and lower pressure overall, as I do.The gentle shower pattern, a favorite for me, works really nicely with a nice overall spray and decent enough pressure to water the back of my 8' deep garden as effectively as the front.  The jet is great.  The pattern ring doesn't turn quite as easily as my Toro nozzle, nor is the trigger quite as easy to squeeze, but both are quite doable even with arthritis in my hands and the lock is easy to flip into place so you don't have to squeeze the trigger for long periods.  The patterns are so much more effective than the more expensive red and silver Toro, I'm definitely replacing others with this one when needed.

I used to live on nearly and acre of property with a row of pines along the back.  They would get all brown near the bottom so I would try and prune them up to about the point where they could get enough sun to stay green. To do that you need a pruner with a little reach to it?I saw this model on TV and hunted it down, finding it first on Amazon.  I could barely believe the price quoted on the TV show, (it wasn't a commercial, it was a how-to show) they said the stick only cost about [$$$].  Its not quite that cheap, but the quality here is excellent.  It uses a chain, not unlike a bike chain, to drive the extended cutter. It uses a slider, leverage system to pull the chain to make the cuts.  The cutting blades themselves are very sharp and can be adjusted to any angle.  This becomes an important concern when you have about a dozen pine trees to trip.The stick will also do fine when you don't need the extended length.  Remember those hedge trimmers that looked like a huge pair of scissors?  I used to hurt my wrists every year, trying to get enough momentum to trim the bushes in front of the house I was renting.  If you tried to cut too, slow it would get stuck, too fast, and the handles would stop abruptly hurting my wrists!  This cutter, although smaller than a hedge trimmer, cut so quick and easily that it made trimming the bushes a pleasure.  I could even get lazy, and sit down in a chair, and do them from a distance. Try that with your electric model! The bushes never shaped up so well before.The blades will cut close to a one-inch branch, and I haven't had to sharpen it yet.  Just keep the chain free of dirt, and keep a little mower oil on it, or cycle spray and it continues to work like new.  Sometimes they just make a tool that becomes the defacto standard for a while, and for my money this is it.  Don't risk cutting your arm off with a chainsaw.

We use the electric string trimmer to trim the grass against the fence around our entire yard. As for all the other trimming in the yard- around the house, the garage, around bushes, trees, sidewalks, the patio, gardens, corners and utility poles, these Fiskars Grass Shears are just perfect!These shears are meant to trim grass and lighter plants, not anything thick, but since grass is always growing around everything in our yard, they get a constant workout.  The 3 foot height is just perfect- no bending or stooping ever. There is an orange turning device on the blades, allowing you to turn these blades to any angle you need. The blades actually turn a full 360 degrees. The 5 inch blades are fully hardened for long lasting sharpness and also lock for storage or when you are turning them. We noticed they do come with a slight oil on the blades themselves.I contacted Fiskars and asked about any maintenance for the blades, and they told me they should stay sharp for years, but you could add a sharper edge to them in time with a hand sharpener- similar to a lawn mower blade sharpener. Cleaning and lightly oiling them when they become dirty will keep them cutting perfect.  Fiskars actually has a lifetime guarantee against any defects in workmanship.  For under $35.00, these are a must have for saving my back and knees with the constant maintenance of yard trimming. These are not just for older people, as I've always had bad knees- and I wish I had known about these years ago!The thought of trimming all the constant grass around the yard made me not want to do it. I'd have to get out my small shears, my knee pad or a stool to sit on- depending on the height of the grass or weeds. Afterwards, I'd need my heating pad and linament for my aching back and knees, not to mention Aleve or some other pain killer. Spending so much time in pain made me dread trimming. Now, I just grab the Fiskars Long Handled Shears- stand, trim and that's it. These shears are worth much more than 5 STARS, and I know I will never be without them again, as saving my back and knees are worth everything!\",\n",
       " 'Poor execution Fiskars badly missed the target on this one.  Kudos to them for trying to fill the niche though, but in all honesty, this is almost as bad as having nothing at all.  Yes, it does work, but not very well. Yes, it\\'s sharp out of the box, but won\\'t stay that way for long.  I\\'ll take a wild guess and say that no one in their R&D; department actually used the finished product.  If they did, they\\'d realize that it\\'s an effective trimmer for 10 sq feet of grass (maybe less).  After that, ergonomics, build quality, and most importantly, fundamental design flaws reveal how a great idea can become a poorly executed product.First, the blades need to ride above the grass by way of wheels or some sort of slick bump underneath.  Second, the steering knob needs to be larger, adjustable, and attach to the pole instead of the top handle.  Third, the gauge of wire should be beefed up - there\\'s too much flex in the existing one.  Fourth, the pole should be at least 4\" longer. Fifth, the quality of plastic could be upgraded for use in a harsher environment (or dispose of plastic altogether).  Lastly, the blades should at the very least, be made out of steel -- bonus points for drop forged and hardened!I completely understand the price point vs quality quandary manufacturers face, but here they really took the low-end, budget approach.  It seems Fiskars tried to implement their fine line of inexpensive scissors to the lawn/garden environment.  The quality of materials is perfectly suited for indoor gardening, but who here has a living indoor lawn?I guess we\\'ll have to give it a little more time before human-powered lawn equipment becomes available in a wider selection and price points.  I\\'d definitely be one of the first in line for a better version.',\n",

However, I also clipped and really pinched my right index finger and I was trying to use these pruners with one hand.  They are just too large for me.  I think the swiveling handle is the culprit.

The rolling handle took some getting use to, worked well but was different than anything I had used before, like it now though.  I would recommend these to anyone. I have several Fiskars tools, geared loppers, pruning poles etc., and that really is the reason I bought these since the others work great for me and all have held up to work.  When I read some of the bad reviews of these I have to remember some people need instructions on which end of a knife to hold while using.  These let me trim faster and with less effort than anything I have ever used,  believe me I've used several and cussed most of them.

       " \"Clever and Rugged Design, Painless Hand Lopper This the next best thing to having a full size lopper in the palm of your hand. It's very strong with a power gear mechanism that makes cutting painless.  Because of the power gear action, the trigger handle rotates, softening the blow when the sheers get through the branch.  With traditional sheers, the snapping action can be painful after an hour or two of heavy duty pruning.These are heavy pruners, the grip is very comfortable.  I've only had these for two years, but it's going strong.  I wouldn't recommend it for professional u because of the exposed coil spring which is likely get clogged or damaged under heavy abuse, but it's great for the home owner.This performs the job of countless other cutting implements (small sheers to a medium duty lopper).  It's not a delicate cutter, but until recently, I was using it to deadhead my flowers with good results.\",\n",

I have used other Fiskar products many times and had normal expectations confirmed.Despite what a few other reviewers might say, everyone has the right to state accurate facts about a faulty product.

       " \"Very useful, very durable, and very comfortable I've had this pruner for several years, and I've used it for a variety of tasks, including pruning roses and other bushes, to trimming off small tree branches. I've even used it for branches that were probably too thick for the tool, but when you have it handy, sometimes you use a tool for a purpose that it wasn't intended. Even when I try to go through something too large, it hasn't broken or jammed in such a way where I couldn't remove it and take it from another angle to finish the cut. That shows how durable it really is.I've had no issues with using this pruner for all those tasks, as it allows me to trim individual faded rose buds with one hand. The spring-loaded handle keeps the resistance at the right amount so it isn't necessary to fiddle around with it just to keep a decent grip.If I were to lose this pruner, or if it were to finally break, I would not hesitate to purchase another one as a replacement. I'm very satisfied with it and recommend it to anyone looking for this type of tool.\",\n",
       " \"When I placed my order I had some doubts about this items quality. When I placed my order I had some misgivings about these hand pruners. That is because I could not tell by Amazon's photo if this was the pruner I needed and how sturdy it is. Since I have had good luck with Fiskars I decided to go ahead and order it.I received the pruners today and I am going to break one of my rules on writing a review. I prefer to wait and use the product before doing a review. I am doing this because these are obviously TOP QUALITY pruners. Arthritis sufferers please take note of what I am about to say.The very first thing I noticed about the pruners is that the bottom handle ROTATES as you squeeze them. This allows you to put far more power into using these with a LOT LESS effort. A wonderful feature if you do not have a strong grip.The photo made these pruners look to me like they were mostly plastic. I immediately saw that I was wrong. All the parts that count are of high quality metal. I will not use them on large branches but I think they could be used on large branches in a pinch.As soon as I got them out of the box I just had to try them. They were excellent for clipping off very small branches in areas where there was not much room to operate. They are SO EASY to use. Once done with the smaller branches I went to larger ones. They cut them with ease. The literature that came with them claimed that they can cut branches up to 3/4 inch. I believe they could but I refuse to do it. I like these clippers so well that I want to take very good care of them so that means I will not cut branches that size with them. I want these clippers to last a long time for me.In conclusion I am very impressed with these clippers. I intend to post some of my own pictures of these clippers on Amazon because I believe I can do a bit better job. I have never done that before with an Amazon product. That is how impressed I am with these pruners. If I run into a problem with them I WILL EDIT this review as soon as it occurs. I very much doubt I will have to do that. I think 99% of all people who buy these pruners will be happy with them.\",\n",

Only one of the two is a blade, the other is just a hold for the branch.Unlike other branch cutters I\\'ve seen, this one cuts the branch like a scissor, not squeezes the branch like pliers; which means, you won\\'t have branches hanging on threads still on the tree.The cutting mechanism provides clean and easy cuts that separate even the toughest branches (upto 2 inch)!I highly recommend this one!; and that\\'s very high praise coming off of my lips!

       " \"you CAN get replacement blades; you'll need it I've usually found Fiskars gardening products to be innovative and effective, but there's usually a kink in the design.  I still swear by the Power Lever shears because the blades move parallel and effortlessly, but the kink is the retaining pin which is a pressure fit which simply loosens with use as the hole in the blades enlarge.  As to this very lovely and innovative Power Gear lopper, well, let's say there are a lot of kinks.  As you may have discovered, the handles break and the blades are fragile.  Just how fragile?  Check Home Depot's website for feedback on this very lopper and you'll even see pictures of the chipped Titanium blade.  It happens a lot, a whole lot.  Quality control may well be to blame, but the material used in the titanium blade is just not solid or steel.  My blade broke or rather chipped the first week of use and the broken surface revealed something that looks like pot metal.  The material in the blade looks like a composite, a grainy composite.  If you look at the blade you'll see that's it's very hefty and designed to withstand a direct applied force, but apparently not a force related to twisting, which would act against the cutting edge with increased leverage due to the unusual depth of the blade and its almost rectangular shape.  So you have high tech materials that when working, operates as advertised, save for that extra span needed to clear the blade around let's say a 2 inch branch.  BUT here's the good news:  Fiskars has replacement blades.  Here's the not so good news:  Fiskars charged me a reasonable $7.99 for the blade, but a very, very hefty shipping and handling ($4.00 for the handling) charge of $11.39, making the modestly priced blade $19.38 to purchase and receive.  The replacement blade (they're determined by the distance between the mounting holes)is steel and shaped like traditional lopper blades:  no more composites, no more thick blades, which tells you something.  As to Power Gear hedge shears, well , count your blessings with the lopper, because there ain't no replacement parts for the hedge shears from Fiskars, and their kink is the composite Power Gear mechanism, which breaks teeth with a passion, rendering the unit useless, unless you have a similarly wounded twin, because the mechanisms are comprised of two sets of power gear parts, that are interchangeable front and rear.

I have cut up to 1.5\" diameter with this...any larger than that and I reach for a saw.My only complaint is that to get the large branches, you have to open the handles up all the way due to the power gear (almost180 degrees apart).

The 3:1 gearing helps these loppers cut quickly, BUT it also means that the handles have to open three times wider than ungeared loppers.  if you're trimming an outside branch, that's not a problem, but I've found them almost impossible to use when trimming branches next to tree trunks and in other dense foliage.If you choose to buy these, make sure that you also have some regular loppers around or you're going to be muttering to yourself a lot.\",\n",

That's the reason for only 3 stars. After today's malfunction I wouldn't order them again.  Plus the price has gone up in a year from $8.68 to $11.79.

Blades stay sharp for a long time, then take very well to a sharpener.Regarding bonsai:  This snipper is too large for bonsai work:  The blades are not fine and small and exact enough.I did find another Fiskars snipper, a bit longer in the handle and the blades, that I find better for using on roses.  Longer handles and longer blades keep my fingers further away from the thorns and that's a good thing.  I looked for that product here on Amazon, but didn't find it.  I just mention it so you can be on the lookout.  The handles are different and there is a hook on the bottom of the handles to hold them together.UPDATE July 2013:  We now have only one pair...I used it to snip a small Japanese eggplant and one of the blades snapped right at the joint.  It is very vulnerable at the joint because of the hole that is drilled in each blade where they are joined together.  So, it's still a great snipper for very delicate things, but nothing more.\",\n",

       " 'Made it fun to split firewood. I bout this after my power company felled a couple trees on my property that were encroaching on power lines. They cut them into 2-3 foot sections (and a couple 6-8 foot sections... thanks a lot!) and left them where they lay. I cut them into standard 16\" sections with a chainsaw and got to work on them (still pretty green) with this axe.First piece I hit was a smaller section, only about 8 inches or so thick and maybe 10 in diameter. I struck dead center on the first swing, and the halves flew apart about 6 feet, leaving me with my axe burried about 2 inches deep in my chopping stump. For the smaller length pieces like this, I only really had to let this axe fall with its own weight.On to the larger pieces...I put the first 16 inch log, about 10\" diameter, up on the stump and had a one-hit split on that one, too. Now, I\\'m not a big guy (5\\'6\"), and I have only split firewood 2 or 3 times in my life. My buddies showed me proper technique on a camping trip so I wouldn\\'t cut my leg off, but that\\'s all the training I had. I really only planned to test the axe out on a couple pieces and save the rest for another day, but it was so much fun splitting the wood with this axe, I finished the whole lot! Not all of them were one-strike splits, mind you, and some of the more twisted or knotty pieces gave me a little trouble. This is not a magic axe. But it got through everything, including pieces that came from where the tree bifurcated. Many of my splits ended with the axe burried in the stump I was chopping on, even after going through a nice 16\" log. Left me sweaty and smiling.I also like to smoke meat, so I used it to chop some of the scrap-sized logs into chunks for my smoker. It worked well for this, but I think I\\'m going to buy the x7 hatchet for that purpose in the future. This axe was a little too heavy and long-handled to easily take care of the smaller work. Still, I split a large box of wood chunks with it by \"choking up\" on the handle and am thrilled with the results.I would buy this again or recommend it to others in a heartbeat.

       " \"The best splitting axe, hands-down. I've only been splitting wood for about 10 years, but in that time I've gone through 5 axes including this one. Two were regular axes, the fiberglass handle on the one split and frayed, the head on the other came off and was not repairable. Regular axes have their place, but if you're splitting all day long they are NOT what you want.I had an old school wooden splitting maul axe I got from a buddy that I used for about two seasons, and I thought it was the best thing ever. However it weighed over 12lbs. A great muscle builder, but not quite as fun when you get older. I came across a similar splitting maul at Lowes, TrueTemper. It was great that it only weighed 7lbs, and I found I could split more in a day with it using faster swings. After 4 seasons with that, constant resharpening, I came across the hardest Oak I've ever seen. I was really struggling with the TrueTemper, finding myself constantly having to take double swings to get through a piece (sometimes more). It was embarrassing almost, until I had a party one night and 4 different guys tried the axe on this tree and all failed equally. It was perfectly sharp and at the proper angle, I just couldn't easily get through the wood..Then I found this.. I instantly found myself just TEARING through the wood, like it was nothing. I honestly couldn't believe it. This axe is 6.25lbs, about 3/4lb lighter then the TrueTemper. So I could more easily, and with slightly more speed swing it. I think the key to it's victors is the angle of the blade and the maul/wedge. The blade edge (long ways) angles back towards the handle so when you strike the wood you don't have to compensate for the axe to hit it at the perfect angle (although depending on the wood height you still need to hit it right). Then the wedge is a much lesser degree of incline then the Lowes, that the maul has a chance of getting into the wood and pushing through before the maul starts splitting it apart. The Lowes one had a much steeper angle towards the edge of the blade, so it on really hard wood it was getting stuck there as soon as the blade touched the wood.There's honestly no other splitting maul options in my mind. I could never recommend anything other then this, because it is simply the best in all splitting situations. Other good points on it is :-corrosion resistant head steel (although please don't leave it outside, it will dual the edge)-hollowed out handle thats even more lightweight, but EXTREMELY strong-lifetime limited warranty-strong head through handle design, looks much more durable then your standard axe or maul-head cover to protect the blade and anyone/thing that might come in contact with it.I also recommend getting theFiskars 7861 Axe and Knife Sharpenerand hitting it frequently. I usually don't go more then a 1/4 of a cord without sharpening, sometimes an 1/8th. It definitely makes it a lot more easier to split - especially for hard or wet wood.\",\n",
       " 'Bounces or Splits My old, heavy maul frequently got stuck in the piece of wood.  This one bounces out until it splits, eliminating the effort to pull it back out of the wood and getting it part way into position for the next stroke.  I can also split larger pieces of wood with it.',\n",
       " 'Excellent Axe Never splitting wood before I went into this venture a bit nervous.  But I did end up splitting a 1/4 cord of wood from big logs rather easily.  I heard the trick was speed. However I found just the normal almost over the head with &#34;no extra push&#34; but having good control worked every time.  The bade did exhibit tiny chips, but I kept it sharpened as several recommended.  The price is great and it feels virtually impossible to break. Although I read some had broken the handle. I did over swing once but it did not seem to mark the handle. It did make me concentrate that much harder. I did find stepping back a half of step kept me from compensating as I bent coming forward.

I just wanted to try it out when I first got it, so I took a few pieces of some hardwood into the driveway just to see how far it would go down into the wood - I never expected it to slice completely threw and still have enough energy to makes a nice chip in the concrete.  All I can say is wow, I immediately went inside and ordered the 14\" and 8\" hatchets & fiskars sharpener.  I\\'m 6\\'4\" and yes, the first couple of strikes I noticed the difference in the length of the handle - however if you follow proper form when splitting wood, you are in absolutely no danger of hitting your shins or feet.

Thanks Amazon.Let me say in general I despise Fiskar tools and never buy them. While some are very well designed the price point demanded by all you people who buy made in China or made India lousy products at Home Depot means Fiskar has to lower the price point to where the quality is not commercial. Fiskar tools in general are not commercial and I have destroyed or worn out every Fiskar tool in short order as I have a large property and commercial orchards and timber land and  my tools are heavily used especially by the \\'help\\' that does not have to pay for the tools.In general I stick with Gransfour Bruks (Sweden), Vaughn (USA), Estwing (USA), Milwaukee (USA-electric saw), Silky Saws /cutting hatchets (Japan) or the professional Grade Husqvarna chainsaws when it comes to felling timber.I took down a big ponderosa pine and was splitting it green. My  near six pound maul was having problems with the big rounds as the wood was very wet. And it is a hassle to use a wedge and 8/10 pound hammer. And my 8 lb maul had a broken handle.Gransfour Bruks does not make an 8 lb maul. I checked the USA sources. No one made an 8 lb maul.I checked with Craftmans who while they do give a lifetime guarantee make their 8 lb Mauls in China now. So no 8 lb splitting mauls made in the USA anymore that I could find, if you know of one let me know. I have my old 8 pound maul head which was made by Craftsman in the USA but have to find a handle for it. Glad I saved the head now.China  is gutting the USA with its currency rigging and we send them fake paper money and they send lousy products with a lot of \\'cheating\\' in the steel quality so fat cat Home Depot Shareholders and Fat Cat Chinese sweat shop owners is all you have and then you get a lousy axe and the \"opportunity\\' to make yourself poorer and Home Depot Shareholders and the Communist Chinese richer. And a sharp, well designed long lasting tool is the safest tool.Sad to see Craftsman Tools which are nearly commercial grade  go to China. People buying these cheap made in China tools at Home Depot or Sears are hurting us all and especially the people who need commercial grade tools or the 20 pc of America that is unemployed. It is unethical to buy tools made in communist china or india as they use slave labor and you\\'re taking a job away from an American/Canadian and china/india rigs it currency to give its manufacturers the ability to drive USA quality vendors out of business. Buy local. It is \\'greener\\' for this politically correct generation of MTV bra....er kids to buy local.I was very skeptical about the review about this axe, given my prior experience to wear out Fiskar tools in no time or have the help break them in no time,  but I ordered one against my better judgement as Fiskar tools are at least made in Finland which has good protection for labor. And the Finns have a big timber cutting industry they manage well so I suspected maybe the Axe was better or the Finns would just buy the Granfours Bruks\\' axes from Sweden. So the pressure was on Fiskars to come up with something world class. They surely delivered. This is a superb tool!!This axe is very, very well balanced and designed,  as well balanced and designed as the Gransfour Bruks splitting axe or splitting maul which is saying a lot. It splits like a dream and has the same splitting ability as an 8 lb maul at a much lighter weight which really, really surprised me. So it is particularly good for older people like me that are starting to have trouble with swinging the big mauls all day. The ergonomics are perfect for a 6 foot tall man. The blade keeps its splitting edge well. Splitting a Cord of Pine is near effortless. The only problem is I don\\'t get the good workout anymore the splitting is so effortless. You might not even break a sweat splitting with this axe if you touch up the edge after every cord with a stone. I\\'m a strong big guy and I was splitting wet 1 foot ponderosa rounds with a 3/4 raise and one arm. It Split just from the gravity fall with the dull factory edge. Truly amazing. Not even my Gransfour splitting axe does that and they shipped it with a dull edge for safety when I tried the dull edge first cut test with just a one arm 3/4 raise. This axe was truly amazing once I put a professional edge on it and got after those 30 in rounds with no problems although you do need some skill to crack a wet 30 inch round on the first go.FYI - Never ever take a splitting axe or maul behind your head. Learn to split and/or you need to get a heavier axe. I never take ad axe behind my head and have never seen professional fallers or buckers to so at least back in the days when they did not have chainsaws and people learned how to use an axe properly.I would have preferred a leather sheath but the plastic one it comes with is very clever. Plastic is not good for the environment. You can always grow more cows or wood.The only question I have is if the handle well hold up and how easy it is to replace. Fiskar steel is better than average, not as good as say Silky Saw steel or Gransfours Bruk steel which is world class,  but it is as good as Estwing steel or Vaughn steel so it is great steel. This axe has a commercial grade head as far as steel quality. It is a great, great head.I gave it five stars as for the price you can\\'t beat this splitting axe. For the homeowner or non professional  you cant beat this splitting axe and the only shame is that Vaughn or Estwing don\\'t make a splitting maul or heavy splitting axe in the USA. This axe is the bomb as this generation says.The only question is how many \\'years\\' of hard use can you get out of the axe handle for professional splitters. But you could buy 4 of these for the price of the Gransfour  maul and this splits better although Gransfours won\\'t like to hear that. The Granfours of course last several generations the steel quality is so good so if you don\\'t want to have your kids buy tools go with Granfours axes and maul if you can afford them. I inherited my grandfathers gransfour axes and I am an old man now and they still cut/split like they were new.Given what is available in the market for high quality 6-8 pound mauls not made in China or India or the third world  this splitting axe is the best choice for the home owner with a lot of wood to split especially big rounds. It really cracks those big rounds I was using a estwing wedge and 8/10 lb Vaughn sledge to break.Looks like they are selling enough of these I can get a new handle if it breaks and the handle is under warranty but I always misplace receipts. I\\'m going to put some coffee can tin underneath the head to extend the life of the handle as the head is a \\'perfect\\' design. They should give a raise to the engineer who designed this axe. I will  buy a few more of these.In summary a superbly designed axe with capability to split equal to a good usa made 8 lb maul with near commercial quality ex for the handle and lack of a leather sheath. For the price you can\\'t beat this tool and its made in  Finland where the government respects labor and not China or India nations looking to gut and steal USA and Canadian jobs by rigging their currency and employing child labor.Too bad about the cheap looking plastic sheath. A leather sheath and a commercial grade handle of top quality hickory would make this a forever tool and I would gladly pay $75 dollars or more to get the upgrade to the commercial handle and a good sheath. Gransfour is on the run with this axe at last. Heck I would pay 125 dollars for his head on a commercial grade handle it is that good.Thanks Fiskar. Thanks for providing us with an ethical buying choice and such a superb design. Fix your other tool lines and I will be a buyer. This makes up for all the other Fiskar tools I wore out or the help broke. So Fiskar owed me as I don\\'t take back tools I wear out. That is my job to be a buyer and pay a fair price for high quality.This axe has HIGH QUALITY although its is nothing to look at as far as aesthetics. Only Gransfour makes beautiful axes anymore.',\n",

I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made, but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear, just some nice scars.

       " \"The best wood splitter I have ever owned I bought the 36 inch Fiskars Splitting Axe based on the great reviews of it here early in the Spring of 2013.  I like the long handle and it works good for someone of my height (6 feet).  I can say this wood splitter has been as good as people say it is and is by far the best wood splitter I have owned.  I used to go though a wood handle on my old wood splitter every year because of wear and tear with an occasional miss of my target.  This wood splitter is far lighter and far more durable.  I have cut about 4 cords of wood with it so far and am very pleased with how it works.As many others point out, you will need to keep this sharp for it to work correctly, and I recommend getting the Fiskars 7861 Axe and Knife Sharpener along with this.  I sharpen it every hour or two of good use.  If I notice the wood isn't splitting well, I sharpen it again (it is easy to loose track of time when splitting wood).  I keep the cover on it at all times when not in use as this is not something you want to fall on anything accidentally.I want to thank everyone here for their insightful reviews, which got me to buy this and to Fiskers for making such a great product.  I have been splitting wood for about 10 years now and I only wish I knew about this product when I first started.  I cannot recommend this product enough!\",\n",
       " \"An excellent product After splitting hundreds of cords of firewood, this is the best splitting maul that I've used.  The hollow handle cuts down on the weight and the efficient design of the wedge make splitting wood much easier.  I was able to split 3-foot cedar rounds relatively easily after failing to be able to with my old splitting maul.  I use the 36 inch handle, but sometimes choke up a bit to get more force.  This is an excellent design that allows you to split wood more quickly with less effort.\",\n",
       " 'The other 1000+ reviewers are correct This is an item I purchased based on reviews.  I barely looked at any other splitting axes.The reviewers were right.I am new to splitting, but watched some videos to learn.  This is a solid axe, yet the lightweight handle gives a great balance and reduces fatigue versus heavier, wood versions.  I have a lot of Fiskars tools so I know their plastic-composite is incredibly strong.  They also have a great warranty.In short, if you use this axe how you are supposed to, you will not have a problem splitting logs.',\n",
       " \"Great Tool With a yard full of cut oak and a 20-year-old axe, progress was slow until this dimwit figured out he needed a new axe. After a little bit of research I decided on the Fiskars X27 with the longer handle. After several days of chopping wood I am a believer. The axe arrived in a timely manner with a sharp edge burrowed safely in the protective, snug fitting head cover.Some of the oak sections left for me are 17-20 inches in diameter, an impossibility for my old axe. With the Fiskars I made quick work of a 17&#34; piece and an 11&#34; log today. In fact with three hits I was able to split the larger log right down the middle. For other pieces instead of hitting in the middle I chopped pieces off of the edges until the log was small enough to split in the middle.I like this new axe quite a bit. It's sturdy, nicely designed aesthetically, and cuts like nothing I've ever used before without needing the strength of Hercules. The Fiskars is just a little longer than my old axe and is just the right length for this 5 foot 10 inche amateur lumberjack. Occasionally I forgot about those few extra inches of length and hit my target with the axe handle. Eventually I learned to stand back just a little further.At first I wondered if any product could live up to so many positive affirmations. This axe does and for me is well worth the money.\",\n",

It makes it incredibly simple to switch devices on the hose without having to shut off the water. For the past 6 months I have heavily used all of them and none have leaked at the quick connector or the screw fittings! You can pick up a set of o-ring from harbor freight or buy the proper ones from Gardena to replace the quick connectors if they fail (haven't had any issues yet). You can also try to oil them to bring them back to life, especially if you've left it out over winter.These seem really durable. I have had these on hoses and sprayers that have dropped on pavement and not broken off. I've had several cheaper hose fittings that either started leaking within the first year or broke apart the first time they touched pavement. I expect these to last many years without needing replacement.Had a slight issue when I ordered one of the packages was missing one of the female quick connect fittings from the box - Amazon quickly replaced though.

Much to my delight, I found these years ago when buying a new sprinkler (a Gardena) and haven't been able to do without these since.I have a two-way connector attached to my spigot with a QC (Quick Connector), one side goes to our auto-timer that runs the sprinkler (told you I was a lazy gadget lover!!), and one to the regular cleaning/tasking hose. On the end of my tasking hose is another QC so I can slap on another sprinkler or nozzle with very little effort. Because I have a QC on the spigot as well, I can easily change hose configuration without breaking my back because I'd have to bend over AND twist around to access that one.NOTE: Because these are made of plastic, they do have a limited life - especially if you leave them out all year long. (Been there, done that.)  The summer sun and winter freeze will cause the pieces to crack sometimes, so be sure to check them before you use them at the start of the season.Part of the fun is figuring out which pieces should go to what. Have fun with that.

I have a small air compressor that I thought would fit inside it because it is a bit less than the 21 inch height from the description but the inside of the box is a little under 18&#34;.

What happens is the central support for the wheel simply snaps and the reel then hangs at an odd angle. Soon, it will just fall off. At least it gives a bit of warning.Examining the carcasses of my dead reels I've learned that the plastic bleaches in the sun and the heat and then becomes brittle. It just crumbles. If the reel is full of hose, that extra weight doesn't help much either.I'm going to try knocking back to just 50 feet of hose instead of the full reel of hose. My experienced guess is that will work  better. Also I'll spray some UV protectant on the hub before I mount the reel. That may help.So why do I keep buying these if they don't last too long? Well, for one I've got my holes drilled in the brick and I really like just being able to slap the new unit in place of the old one without drilling even more holes for some new reel which may or may not last any longer than this one.

It's slightly different than the one I replaced, requiring me to drill 3 new holes. Not an issue with me. Like other reviews I've read, the round parts that are on either side of the wrapped hose were also warped. That means it came from the factory/shipper that way. There was no damage to the shipping box. Perhaps the heat from the sun will help straighten that out. I also read their 5 year warranty, which I doubt I would ever use. The defective one needs to be shipped back to the company at owners expense, they will fix or replace it, then you must pay for return shipping. That is NOT a good or reasonable warranty. Still, I'm satified with my purchase. UPDATE: IT DIDN'T EVEN LAST ONE YEAR. WHILE I LIVE IN ARIZONA WHERE IT'S HOT, THE PLASTIC DRIED OUT AND FRONT PART WITH THE HOSE FELL OFF AFTER BREAKING.

You can buy more from Cameron international or Amazon.com. I use it all the time and never have any problems with smoke filling up the kitchen and the smoke detector never goes off.

I have also smoked chicken, turkey wings, sweet potatoes, potatoes, shrimp, burgers, and cheese all with excellent results.  I put the potatoes in the microwave for a few minutes to shorten the cooking time. The chicken doesn't brown as in a traditional outdoor smoker or grill but you can finish cooking it in the oven to brown it.  If it's smoke flavor you are after, this is a very good alternative to outdoor smoking!Cleaning the smoker is a breeze if you first spray the rack with cooking spray.

It's nice to see that Char-broil has taken the initiative to break free from the standard black, rectilinear grill. This grill tucks neatly into the corner of my back deck and looks great. Friends are always commenting on it.As for cooking, the smaller grill surface has proven to be ample for parties of four when cooking fish, steaks or skewered items. For sandwich-style grilling (e.g., hamburgers, hotdogs, etc.) you can cook for twice that many. The cooking surface itself is a refreshing change as well; the metal slats are thick and give restaurant-style grill marks to your food, while providing more surface area for smaller items to sit on.

My grill did come with the smaller cannister, but I bought it quite awhile ago, so perhaps they no longer do.  If yours doesn't, it's no great loss, in my view, because once again, I've never used the smaller cannister.

       " \"Worthless, get the Rescue hard plastic yellow traps.Update Changed from 1 to 3 stars. 'Worthless' was initially noted, as the YJ's often walked in and just walked back out. It will trap some initially, but later catches flys AND hornets. The bags often have defects. This 'type' of bag device is great for flies (get the 'Big Bag' fly type as it stinks more like a ripe out-house and holds lots) but this (YJ type) smells like rotten fish (better to smell bad and catch things that sting you). Get the 'Big Bag Fly Trap' type like this for flies but use Rescue yellow plastic traps for YJ's. (W.H.Y traps are worthless so read the reviews). These will trap some flys and YJ's and a few Hornets going in for live food. Hornets will not fit in the hard yellow Rescue YJ traps, but hornets do fit in these, and do go in after flys and YJ's.Hornets are very unique and there seems to be no attractant for hornets, except people, and other live insects. Stick with Rescue (hard yellow-domed plastic type) for YJ's. This type, made for flies, work 'great' for flies. Hornets seem to hang out at the bag-type fly and yellowjacket traps to capture live insects. Sometimes these traps and the fly traps capture hornets (that is why I switched from 1 to 3 stars) that go in looking for live flys or maggots but it is not real common. I find one hornet hangs out at he top of the trap at a time, and when there is a hornet there the other bugs disappear. When it is gone the other critters reappear. These traps smell like rotten fish, which is fine, and the fly traps smell like outhouses, which is really strong if the wind is wrong. Hard to eat near the fly traps. I have trapped several hornets that go in due to the activity in the bags.Hint: If you add a very little non foaming, non smelling, dish soap to any water-type trap the insects drown quickly instead of crawl out, dehydrate, wear-out, or over-heat. These critters (YJ's and hornets) only know to sting and are constantly hunting for food for their hive, to feed the larvae (more future scavangers). They sting live bugs and bury them in with the growing insect to feed on while they are in suspended animation = creepy).Update 8-7-13:I still think these are not as good as the reusable Rescue hard trap (for yellow jackets) which you can re-bait:Pros:-They do catch flys and some YJ's.-They do trap some hungry Hornets looking for live critters.-It is an attractant for flys, YJ's and Hornets (rotten fish smell and activity)-It comes with attractant; just add water and a lead to hang it with.Cons:-They are firm plastic bags, flexes but not soft like a baggie-type, and some have arrived with holes (punctures) in them, which I used duct (Gorilla) tape on to cover then fill. This can lead to a stinky mess if you fill any in the kitchen. I do not know a way around this type of bag and think 'it is the best they can do' for a bag.-Holes develop on the seams after a while. Maybe from the weight of the water.-You have to keep replenishing the liquid that evaporates (I use a little wine/apple juice/sugar-water with a dab of non-fragrant, non foaming dish soap; do not use hot water).-They are one-use and throw away (before tossing I recommend draining the fluid outdoors, away from the house, letting the bag dry out, then throw away in the trash - stinky mess with maggots from flys). I do not recommend just putting a smelly liquid-maggot-filled bag in your trash.-Many yellow jackets tend to walk-in and walk-out, as do hornets and flys.-Stationed at most bags there is a sentry Hornet that posts itself at the entrance and it keeps all YJ's and flys away. Hornets prefer live catch. Other flying insects seem to be afraid of them, and I have seen some Hornets try to sting a bug (from the outside of the bag) that is inside the bag, and they try to catch any that fly around. This problem tends to keep many flys and YJ's away from this type of trap.-I have seen Hornets stationed at the 'fly traps', too, but I have trapped many flys in them so they get 5 stars. I have seen Hornets go in and sting maggots but have not witnessed them flying out with them, not that they don't.-these do not come with a hanging device (so be sure you have one on before you fill it).-you must carefully cut the bag with scissors around the opening to pull out the entrance device before filling and hanging.\",\n",
       " \"Love the convenience and am catching a LOT of Queens Last year was a horrible YJ year here in Northwest Montana.  Although I caught hundreds daily in July with homemade traps (mason jar with soapy water and meat dangling over it) - this year I set the non disposable Rescue traps out in mid-April after 2 YJ in the house.  I was prepared to try to catch queens early and hopefully have a better summer - typically bugs of any kind are not an issue here.When I bought the non disposable, I  also bought these and these are not only lots more convenient but I've been getting 50-75 in each in several days vs 15-20 in the non disposable.  Our weather typically is a string of warm, sunny days followed by cool & cloudy so at the onset of warm and sunny, I set out fresh traps.I have 8 acres of wooded property but am setting traps only in my yard area - maybe slightly less than 1 acre.  I didn't expect to catch so many this early.  I hope it helps.Now - in my area, they seem to do best in the sun.  It is nearly 80 today but most warm days have been 65-70.  I have 2 or 3  of a mix of disposable and non-disposable hung in 5 places from 20-40 feet away from my house.I'm using water in the traps, not apple juice.FWIW, I did try adding some of my mason jar meat traps and there was no interest in those at this point.  Also, previous years, I've caught wasps and hornets in beer.  Beer did not work last year or this for the YJs.  I also tried Hawaiian Punch last year - no, they liked my chicken leg bones with a bit of bbq sauce.  Crazy.

Next time I checked, this thing was FULL of stinging insects, yellow jackets and a few hornets.  There are still some yellow jackets around my deck, but a lot fewer.

Still, the trap only lasted a week before becoming filled up with what I estimate might be one thousand flies.FWIW, this trap works.  It attracts flies to a smelly liquid trap where they subsequently drown.  During the week I had it up hanging 20 feet from the house in a tree, no flies came into the house.  I'll take a break for a week, then try it again to see if the trap lasts longer and whether the fly population seems to have decreased.FWIW, take two, I developed a macabre fascination with checking on the trap every few hours to see how many more flies had been caught.

       " \"Impressively effective We had a fly problem a few years ago, so I tried these traps. I was very impressed with the sheer number of flies it caught (my wife was just disgusted). This year we had a bigger infestation, so I tried theRescue Reuseable Fly Trap with Attractant #FTA-SF4and they were nearly ineffective. I purchased a few more of these disposable traps and they're amazing at attracting and catching flies. The smell, however, is quite bad and is almost more offensive than a few rogue flies.The major advantage of this type of trap is that it works in the daytime, when flies are active, unlike an electronic trap like theFlowtron Model BK-40D Electronic Insect Killer (One Acre Coverage)(which I also purchased).The irony, I found, in having such effective attractants is that you get more flies. I moved my traps to the far side of the yard, away from the house, and suddenly we have fewer flies trying to sneak in the side door. (Obvious?)\",\n",
       " \"These are Great They stink like an old outhouse but work great trapping fly's and hornets; the hornets go in to catch a fly or maggot and can't get out. There is usually a sentry hornet that hangs out at the opening, and tries to get fly's from outside the bag, or, goes in after them. Once that hornet is gone, another arrives. Hornets want live bait.Warning: Do not use indoors!! If you fill it in the kitchen or inside your house, do not spill any in the sink, floor, trash, or your hands, as it really reeks, as it is supposed to to attract fly's, like to an outhouse. Some bags do leak from manufacturing defects. Yuck!! It does not wash off easily. Do not use warm or hot water in the bags as you will dissolve the smelly contents too quickly and not attract fly's to the heat. Once hung, refill it, regularly only to the line (it gives them space to crawl in and get stuck inside), and towards the end of the season add some apple-juice to attract more flys and hornets, and yellow jackets. Adding a drop of dish detergent helps them drown quickly, and to sink to the bottom. If you fill it too full, or the dead fly's stack up, the others will crawl out easily. Keep a space between the yellow plastic and the fly's and water. Once full of fly's just unhook it and set it on the ground to dry out then toss the whole bag; it will stink. Be sure once you have opened it that the yellow top seals in the open position from the weight so fly's do not crawl back out. Be careful not to get stung while refilling if a stinger creature is close; you encroach on their hunting territory.These have worked well for me and I prefer The Big Bag model. Highly recommended!! These can stink up an eating, playing, or relaxing area but gets flies like crazy, and some hornets and YJ's. My wife cannot stand the smell so I get the job.\",\n",
       " \"Simply Amazing! I can't fathom a fly catching product working any better. We experienced a few flies in the house this Spring so we purchased this product. In less than one week, this product caught over two hundred flies. What is kind of funny is that this product attracts flies to it...who knew there were that many flies around my house. While the product captures many flies, it also attracts them.  Flies that were not necessarily a problem were captured. Day one a few flies are trapped, and each subsequent day--- by the fifth day, the amount of flies caught was unimaginable. I am going to rid the entire neighborhood of flies at this rate. I am going to stockpile this product.\",\n",

This is perfect for pet owners like myself, in case the dog dumps its love bundles and I don't see it, which can atrack flies.A couple of things you should know about this product:First, it will probably not catch any flies the first day, and let me explain why, the material in the trap and water that you add need to mix for about a day, at which type, a very strong smell will start to come out of the trap, which means it is now working. After the first day, and during the hot ones, trust me, it will be gross, yet amazing thing what this trap can do.Second, you have to constantly add water to the level indicated on the bag, specially during the hot days and if the trap is under direct sun light. This is easy to do with a paper cup or any other small cup.Third, when hanging it, place it away from your doors and windows, or be ready for some nasty smells. The trap has a mixture of eggs(dried) and other products to create a strong odor that flies can't resist.In conclusion, this product DOES NOT USE chemicals at all, it is all natural and catches a great number of fly species; it won't let you down. It works.\",\n",

So I decided to eliminate the flies to eliminate the problem. I then searched Amazon, my go to company for everything and I discovered the fly trap. I was skeptical at first but I opened the top and filled with water ad directed and hung it near my dogs house.

Nary a fly makes it to our patio, even when we have our meals out there.  Before the fly trap, we were constantly swatting and shooing flies while sitting on the patio.  So glad I found these!

The trap was working within 30 minutes of setting it up.I want to thank the reviewer who said he had an issue with cutting the plastic at the top of the trap. Had I not read his review I would have had the same issue. I avoided it by using an exacto type cutting tool to cut the circle out.When setting it up I did spill some of the attractant on the side of the trap. The flies were all over it within 15 minutes and 30 minutes later they were in the trap. Be sure to hang this trap up of the reach of pets. This trap not only attracts flies it also attracts dogs too. Never underestimate the intelligence and leaping ability of a miniature dachshund. She immediately found where I had spilled it on the ground and soon figured out the source. I distracted her, hung it higher, and washed away what spilled on the ground. I mention this only because we mini dachshund owners tend to be very protective of our little heart stealing dogs.A possible mistake I made when setting this out was to hang it in direct sunlight. We have a heat wave at this time and during the hottest part of the day I did not see any flies around the unit. Today I am going to hang it in a shade tree. I'm sure that will work and if it does not I will update this review within a short period of time.I feel that this trap is well worth what I paid for it and as soon as I am done with this review I am going to order at least one more maybe two. One for the front yard and one for the back. I have a fly problem because I have fruit trees, compost piles, a garden, and I live in a tiny town surrounded by farms. The flies in the front yard are a bad problem because when I mow the yard they come out and pester me when I am trying to concentrate on safely mowing the part of my yard where it has steep slopes. You can easily turn your mower over while trying to swat a biting fly. If the yard does not get mowed I wind up with thousands of mosquitoes and dozens of snakes.All in all I am happy with this purchase and I wish I had found this item many years sooner.UPDATE. JULY 28,2011.I'm glad I ordered more. My trap is already full. One more thing I need to mention. Don't hang the bag too close to where you sit or eat outside. The bag has an odor and without that odor the trap will not work. I would experiment by hanging it in different locations. The perfect spot would be close enough to attract flies away from you but far enough that you don't smell it. It also helps to remove things that attract flies away from the trap. Mine hangs in a fruit tree. I had some rotten fruit on the ground that was attracting the flies more than the trap. I raked them up and got rid of them. The next day the flies were swarming the trap even more than they had been.\",\n",

It is a little heavy for me when fully extended but not so bad I can't use it.  One thing I learned is to adjust the head so I make square cuts to avoid any hang up from the branch starting to fall and binding the blades.  Used this to trim limbs over my electric pasture fence while driving my tractor so my Tractor ROPS bar now clears the limbs. If the jaws fit around a limb you can cut it without a terrible amount of strength.  I bought this to trim some tall hedge bushes along the edge of my yard and it worked well for trimming the tall tops.  Have used the saw (3 inch limbs) and it cuts fine if you let it do the cutting and take your time.  Used it to cut some woody stemed large weeds on hard to navigate banks too. Over all a very handy tool.\",\n",

Full instructions on how to make a warranty claim are included on Fiskars\\' website, plus their telephone customer service is excellent.  They sent me a new part plus a link to complete instructions, including pictures, for disassembling the pruner and replacing the part.  My husband was able to effect the repair.  There was no dollar cost to me at all, and this is way better than having to buy another one for $80.May 28, 2014:  I still use this pruner regularly, and it continues to work well after the repair.  The only problem is that you do have to watch the thickness of the branches you are cutting because this pruner will only tolerate so much.',\n",

It was a long box, with 2 separate box pieces taped together.  The UPS man told me it looked like it may be damaged.  It was fine.  I do agree that there should be a box long enough for the item to fit in.  The pole is solid enough that there was very little chance of damage.

       " \"A great investment. By far the best smoker i've ever owned. I have only owned a couple smokers in my life, and after purchasing this one - I don't plan on owning anything else. The Weber Smokey Mountain Cooker (WSM) is a simple, yet incredibly effective water smoker.The WSM has two cooking sections which allows you to smoke a good amount of food (such as a whole turkey and a whole ham simultaneously). The 18 1/2 inch grates allow plenty of food, but you might have to get a little tricky if you want to smoke something like 8 racks of ribs. This can be done if you roll the ribs up and use a skewer to hold them in place. If you aren't trying to entertain large parties, then this is the perfect family smoker.The WSM is coated with porcelain enamel, much like the One-Touch kettle grills. The grates are triple-nickel-plated. The WSM is very sturdy. The material is nice and hefty, you don't get the sense that this smoker was cheaply made. One of the only issues I have with this smoker is the access door. Instead of being hinged it comes completely off the smoker. It can take a little bit of figiting to get it to attach to the smoker, but this is an extremely small issue.The reason people love this smoker is because with a single batch of charcoal you can smoke for an incredibly long time. If you use the minion method then you can smoke for up to 18-20 hours without adding anymore charcoal! For those who aren't aware, the minion method is where you fill the charcoal ring with unlit charcoal, light about 10-15 briquettes and place them on top of the unlit charcoal. Please don't use the minion method with pre-soaked coals. My first smoke was a brisket and for the first 5 hours it stayed exactly at 245 degrees without any adjustments! I thought my thermometer was broken... it wasn't - this smoker is incredibly efficient. Another example is the second time I smoked with this. I smoked a 10 lb brisket, started at midnight. It finished 5:00 PM the following day. That's 17 hours right there. I roused the coals a bit and was able to smoke some stuffed jalapenos for another 2 hours. That's 19 hours on a single batch of charcoal! I am very impressed. I have a Brinkman smoker and when I used that smoker I would get about 2 hours of burn time. The WSM is just so much more efficient and has MUCH better air control.Here are a couple of tips if you plan on buying a WSM (and you should!).Get a decent enough thermometer, such as a candy thermometer so you can check your temperature at the lid. This will become instrumental in your cooking.Unfortunately the WSM has a small water pan. What you should do is buy a replacement Brinkmann Smoke N Grill charcoal pan (don't get the water pan, make sure you get the charcoal pan). You can buy one directly from Brinkmann for about $13.00. If you look hard enough you can find them online for around $5.00 - $10.00. The Brinkmann charcoal pan fits perfectly inside the WSM as a water pan (some say it fits even better!). It also holds more then double the amount of water then the standard WSM water pan. This allows you about 7-8 hours of cooking before needing to refill the pan, which is much better then the 2-3 you get with the standard water pan. Once your temps stabilize you can easily do overnight cooks and also get some shut-eye!To conclude I would like to say that if you are even thinking about getting a  vertical water smoker then stop looking right now. This smoker is near perfect in every single way. With a few tiny modifications you can own one of the best smokers in the world at this price!\",\n",
       " 'Best backyard vertical water smoker you can buy! This thing is ridiculous!  It holds a temperature better than my electric oven.

       " \"I hate being redundant but, yeah, it really is that good Just like everyone else has said, this is a winner.I've owned a few different chimney starters over the years and just never could get them to work reliably.  I always ended up going back to lighter fluid.  Yes, it stinks and it's expensive and it can ruin the taste of your meal if you don't let the charcoal burn down for a long time but it worked every time.  Those Brand X chimney starters didn't always get the charcoal going.The Weber is larger and the design is well thought-out.  Instead of a few holes in the bottom of the charcoal section, it has a grate.  And the grate is kind of reverse-cone shaped so more charcoal comes in contact with the burning newspaper.  The result--it lights pretty much perfectly every time.  All it takes is two broadsheet pages of newpaper stuffed in the bottom.  That's two broadsheets--the equivalent of eight pages of your morning newspaer.  You can also use paper towels--they create less ash.  If you want, you can lightly spray the newpaper or towels with a little Pam or the like.  That's gets the paper to burning quickly.Don't bother with those small, poorly designed, no-name (or even big-name) chimney starters you see around.  The Weber is the one to get.\",\n",
       " \"A list 1. It is taller than the cheapos and has more chimney effect so it works better.2. Is made of heavier gauge steel than the cheapos and lasts longer. I just  leave mine outside. It takes years to rust through. My old one lasted about 5-6 years.3. It will rust like any steel exposed to high heat, so the thicker the metal, the longer it will last.4. The length of time to start the coals depends on the brand of coals, their moisture content, humidity and the way you crumple up the newspaper.5. If the coals fail to catch, then repeat the process. Do not pour lighter fluid into it. Doo.6. I just grab the insulated handle and pour the coals out. I do not use the tipping handle thing so I don't need gloves.7. One of the features of a Weber, and some other grills, is that after you finish grilling, you can shut off the vents and save some of the coals for next time. So, pile the newly lit coals over the old ones. This lights them up and gives you a longer fire as well.8. Weber offers little wire fences that allow you to keep the coals off to one side of the grill. Use this feature. Pour your coals into this area, sear your meat quickly and then move it off to the non-coaled area and put the lid on and let it cook slowly to completion. Add specialty wood chips at this time if you wish. This gives the best result.9. Weber stuff seems to be the best, at least in its price range, and they offer a lot of quality accessories that are properly designed.10.

Don't encourage the b******s, get the real thing._____________________________These are great. The one I reviewed is still good after hundreds of uses.FIRE-STARTING UDATE: sprinkle a little olive oil, or other cooking oil, on the balled-up newspaper.

It starts up quickly and is good to use in about 10-15 min. I have noticed that lower quality bricks do not work as well and that if you over stuff the bottom with paper it will not work right. It smokes a lot! I suggest closing your windows. You really need to have 2 of them when doing large meats such as turkey's and half pigs. That way you can start enough charcoal right off the bat. It also says that you should wait until the coals have a slight white ash on them. I would have to disagree with that because the coals are 30 min from being burned up by then.

My newest obsession never would have taken root if there was not an easy, foolproof way of starting the lump or the briquettes.  I don't have any other chimney to compare this to but it works perfectly every time.  Two sheets of newspaper, dump in your fuel of choice and light it.  10-15 minutes later the coals are ready to go.  If you think the newspaper gives too much ash try paper towels sprayed with some cooking oil instead.

If I'd known this sooner, I would've bought my charcoal grill a long time ago!\",\n",
       " \"Wow!  One use convinced me that this is the way to go Like many other charcoal barbeque enthusiasts, I hate using charcoal lighter fluid.  (Who wants toxic junk smoldering all over their food?)  For years I have used an electric lighter, but ours was on its last legs.  I was tempted to buy a gas grill, as they are fast-lighting, but just really didn't want to spend the money on a product that doesn't perform the way I like.  So, based on the favorable reviews, I decided to try the Weber Chimney Starter.Wow.  Really.I was accustomed to putting the electric lighter under the coals, and preparing other parts of the dinner while the coals were getting started.  And after they had gotten started, it took a while for the fire to really get rolling.I use a Weber barbeque, and every time after I have finished grilling, I close down the vents and save the briquets for another use.  I only have to add a couple of handfuls of new briquets each time I cook.I stuffed the bottom of the Weber chimney starter with newspaper as directed, put in the cold leftover briquets from the last grilling session, and added the usual amount of new briquets.  I lit the newspaper as directed.  At first all it seemed to be doing was producing a copious amount of smoke.  I walked away, and came back just a few minutes later to find the charcoal flaming away most impressively.  The coals were ready in about a quarter of the time that it took using the electric starter.Who needs a gas barbeque for a fast-starting fire?  I had my whole dinner cooked in a half hour from the time that I lit the newspaper.  This charcoal starter is a gem!Update (June 29, 2008):  After using this starter for almost a year (yes, I barbeque in the winter) I have a couple of notes to add.  First, use only the amount of newspaper recommended.  More newspaper cuts down the amount of air able to circulate through the fire, and you just end up with a smoldering mess.  Secondly, don't fill the container full of charcoal.  Doing so extends the time it takes for all the charcoal to ignite, with the end result of making the handle too hot to comfortably hold.  Even if you need a lot of charcoal, only fill the container half-full. Once the briquets are burning, dump them into the barbeque and put more briquets right on top of them if you need more.\",\n",
       " \"Toss the starter fluid, this is the best way to light a fire I haven't used lighter fluid in years, ever since getting one of these.I didn't believe that just a couple sheets of newspaper would be enough to get the charcoal going, but that's really all you need.  I use natural charcoal exclusively (you know, real wood, not gravel and clay briquettes), and this works perfectly with that kind of charcoal.You'll reduce the amount of time necessary to get a usable fire, and you won't have that annoying starter fluid smell or taste on your food.Two caveats to consider: this thing gets very hot by its nature, so use oven mitts when grabbing the handle, and be careful where you put it after dumping the coals, so as to keep small children and yourself from touching it until it cools.\",\n",
       " \"Can't grill without it! The Weber is the best chimney starter I have used.  It's bigger than most others, can be lifted and dumped with one or two hands, and the handle stays relatively cool.  I just ordered a second so I can fill my relatively large barbeque all at once.  If you are not into gas you need this tool.\",\n",
       " \"Reformed Lighter Fluid Junkie I finally gave up on the lighter fluid and bought this last summer.  What a brilliant idea!  I have always used lighter fluid and was notorious for using to much because the charcoal wouldn't light fast enough.  That problem is solved with this chimney starter.  The coals ignite quickly and a full blaze is going within minutes!  Once the flames have died down, just dump them out and start grilling!I have the Performer grill but when I bought the grill, the store didn't have any cartridges so I have been using the chimney starter all summer.  So it's a nice backup if you have the Performer but no gas cartridge.This is a good product for the price.\",\n",

If you are picky about the taste of your food (you will notice the difference if you grill without lighter fluid or pre-soaked coals) then get this handy starter.

Simply add charcoal to rim of chimney, place parafin lighters or newspaper in the bottom. Light newspaper or parrafin lighters and place on charcoal grate in grill.  In 20-30 minutes you will have orange hot smokin' charcoal.This is also a must for cooking things with very long cooking times such as turkeys or roasts.  About 30 minutes before adding additional charcoal, use this puppy to light your coals, and then add to the fire as needed.As I mentioned earlier, I reccomend using this in conjunction with the Weber parrafin charcoal lighters.

By the time the ligher fluid was burned-off, the coals were nearly gone, too.We had just seen Alton Brown's Good Eats episode, The Grill Seakers. He had used a chiminy starter to get his charcoal going, so when we saw one in the store, my wife told me to buy it and try it.Well, after two years of use, that cheap starter has gotten to the point where it's ready to fall apart. I needed a new one, and I needed to add something inexpensive to my Amazon.com order to qualify for free shipping, so I ordered this one.I've got to say, even though I read the reviews, I just wasn't expecting something so big! This thing has half-again as much capacity as my old one. It's also a heavier guage metal, and a better handle.One hint: I lightly spray my newspaper with corn oil before putting it in the chiminey. It never burns away too fast, as just two sheets can do if there's enough wind, and I don't find myself packing too much newspaper in.

Perhaps it can save you or a loved one.Rotisserie cooking lends itself to the acclaimed high heat, short cooking time technique. Hot coals and the self-basting action work well here. One of the major gourmet magazines cooked turkeys every way known and strongly recommended the high heat way. This is also the suggested method for cooking heritage meats and wild game.Starting out at 500+ degrees and ending at something short of US government temperature recommendations is the secret. A turkey, for example, is best taken out of the heat at around 170, or less, and allowed to rest. It will go up around 10 degrees after that.I tie bacon strips onto the breast and add wet smoking wood chips to the coals. Stuff the cavity with an orange and some garlic. Other things could be used, too. I have rotisseried heritage, free range, organic, kosher and regular good quality supermart turkeys with this high-heat method and they have all been good.Governments and institutions have to recommend a heat guaranteed to kill off any and everything, and prevent lawsuits of course. However, fresh good quality meat does not have to be nuked to the point where you could make furniture out of it. Use a separate thermometer, not the supplied pop-out sensor. I am no professional, but I can say it produces the best tasting food.___________________________________UPDATE: Years later, it still works. Here are some things that will help you if you get one of these. First, for a turkey, get two oranges and stick them in the cavities. Then, stick the skewer through them. This keeps the turkey from wobbling around so much as the oranges act like bearings. Also, get some meat wrapping string and spend the time it takes to tie the legs, tail and wings up to the skewer so that the turkey is more like a ball without all sorts of dangling things flopping around. Use lots of string. It is cheap. Know that all the energy of the universe will try to circumvent your efforts, so over-do it with the string. Cut it off with scissors before serving.Coat the turkey with olive oil. Don't baste it again.Obviously, don't stuff it!I don't use the bacon anymore. If you use the temperature recommendations, you won't miss the bacon.  It was a pain to tie on and was kind of a waste.The Polder remote thermometer is nice because the probe is thin and doesn't create a big hole.I stop at 160 degrees now. That's just me. Remember, you can cook it more, but you can't remove the overcooking.Learn how to cut the breast meat off. Don't slice it off while it is on the turkey. Instead, cut down right alongside that breastbone. Then cut in from the side, about half-way down the side, straight in. This gives you a big chunk from that one side.  On a plate, cut it in slices, across it, across the grain. So much more professional and better in every way. And it is easier. If you are having trouble visualizing this, you can google up a demo video or illustration.I saw a TV show where it was demonstrated that soaking the chips makes no difference, so I don't anymore. A couple of handfuls gives a nice, not overwhelming little smoke flavor. You may want more, or none.The Weber a fine device and one that surely will make you the rockstar of turkey cooking. Imagine how pathetic your relatives will seem when they take their sad turkeys out of the oven after hours of worthless basting. There will be murmuring and eye-rolling from those who remember yours. Make sure you tell the others, loudly, how you just sit around drinking while your turkey rotates effortlessly around, cooking perfectly. By the time the hosts are finished with excuses as to why their turkey sucks, again, you will be elevated to near rock-god status. Humiliation is an essential part of any family holiday and you want to be the one doing the humiliation.See the review of the Weber chimney charcoal starter for a good tip on that.\",\n",
       " \"MUST HAVE ITEM FOR WEBER CHARCOAL FANS!!! I waited way too long to buy one of these rotisseries.  What was I thinking?  This thing is fantastic!I cook on my Weber charcoal kettles all the time.  It always comes out great, except for the one time my Beagle chased a deer into the woods and I had to go after her.  I got back about thirty minutes later and my chicken was ruined.  I actually ended up feeding it to my Beagle, so now I am thinking maybe she did it on purpose?  They are pretty smart.  And chasing a deer had to be a ruse to distract me, I mean seriously, what was she going to do if she actually caught the deer?The rotisserie chickens I have cooked so far have turned out much, much better than all the other ways I have cooked chicken over charcoal. And I have cooked chicken a lot of different ways.I have read that rotisseries are self-basting because most of the juices don't drip, they just kind of roll around over the chicken.  Maybe.  But all I know is as long as I take the bird off at around 165 degrees, cover it for about ten minutes, then serve it, it always comes out fantastic.If you have one of these you know what I am talking about.  If you don't, you should get one, you will like it.This is not just for chicken or turkey.  I cooked a chuck roast to slightly over rare and then sliced it up for some excellent roast beef.\",\n",
       " 'Great  investment!! This Weber Rotisserie is the best grilling item that I have bought so far. I did two Cornish Hens and they were so moist and juicy, I couldn\\'t wait to try a roasting Chicken. Well, I finally tried one, and oh, my God!!!! It was AWESOME!!! The taste was like no other rotisserie Chicken that I have ever eaten!! I cooked it slow, about 3 hours, starting with about 12 coals on each side, using the indirect cooking method. I added more coals every hour to keep the temperature about the same (about 325-350). I experimented with basting it with Beer when I added more coals. I also added soaked hickory wood chips with the coals each time. To die for!!!  I also tried a Pork roast. The same awesome results were obtained. Next I will try a Turkey. I am totally sold on this item, and highly recommend it to anyone who owns a Weber 22-1/2\" kettle grill. You won\\'t be disappointed!!',\n",
       " \"great item this kettle rotisserie works GREAT. it's a much better design than what's shown in the ad. what I mean by that is the one in the ad shows metal tabs that rest on the grill, with the new design they got rid of the tabs and flared out the bottom of the ring so the whole ring sits on the grill giving it a nice tight seal. it makes controlling the heat much easier than the previous one. WELL DONE WEBER now as far as the motor it's super quiet and works very well. the spit is one piece steel much better than the two piece rods the ring itself is the same quality as the weber kettle grill. I really didn't want to spend that kind of money on it but after receiving and using it I'm glad I did. this unit is well made and expect to get many years of great grilling out of it.\",\n",
       " \"This will make you look like a BBQ star This rotisserie is made for weber 22 inch charcoal grills.  I got this from amazon and it shipped in record time.  This is a simple accessory with few parts.  There is the skewer with the two prongs that slide over and screw onto it to hold your meat in place.  There is a big ring that sits on top of your kettle and the lid goes on that.  There's a screw-on counterweight to help with even rotation.  And then the motor that slides onto a bracket on the aforementioned ring.  That's it.  Basically no assembly required.  Do you like beer can chicken?  You won't bother after using this.  I'm not a chef so I can't explain how spinning the meat around makes it so good but it does.  Juiciest bird ever, seriously.  Also does roasts well with excellent results too.  I haven't used this for a turkey but I can't see how that wouldn't be outstanding as well.  The motor is quiet, if you care about that kind of thing.  The plug attached to it is ridiculously short so you will probably need an extension cord.  I recommend keeping the box it comes in for storage because otherwise it's kind of bulky and random in the garage.  The only criticism is it's expensive.  But it's one of the coolest BBQ things i own and would buy another in a heartbeat if it was stolen or broken.  But Weber doesn't make them anymore!  So if you are thinking about this, buy now before they are gone forever.  I wish I could get extra prongs for the skewer so I could do two of whatever I am doing without have to jerry-rig it.\",\n",

Picture a wheel cut in half and each half goes on opposite sides of the garden stool, so the wheel itself is not very supported on the inside.  Now, I have another garden stool I got from Home Depot.  The wheels are round on the inside and out, much stronger, roll smoother and have a seat which you can pick up to use as a handle to haul supplies, kind of like a kid's wagon.  On this you cannot.

It feels sturdier than the metal one and does not tip as easily. I have noticed that the metal one now needs repainted and some bolts replaced. Not so with the Garden Hopper. It has sat out in the sun for days and it's paint has not faded. We do store it inside during the winter but we do that for the metal one too.My complaint is about the hinged lid. It takes too much force to open it. I realize that this is necessary because you don't want the lid coming open when you pick it up to carry it.

Just about everybody over the age of thirty has some kind of issue with knee and/or back pain, esp. when you want to do seasonal clean-ups inside or out.I was kind of flabbergasted when I was on my hands and knees, cleaning the bathroom floor, and my knees...hurt!...just from kneeling on the tile. I bought this device to help with that chore, and it\\'s a lifesaver. It\\'s made for outdoor use (and it\\'s one of the sturdiest things I\\'ve ever bought), but for me it\\'s been wonderful for indoor cleaning.The reviews here are excellent, so I don\\'t want to reinvent that wheel. There are just two things I\\'d add from my own observations; that is, things you might not know until you actually order and get this kneeler.First of all, the yellow pad is on both sides, it\\'s not just padded one one side. Now as it\\'s show in this picture, it\\'s something to sit on. If you burn it upside down so the yellow pads are a few inches off the floor, behold! It\\'s a kneeler! The metal \"arms\" that become long when you flip it over are extremely sturdy. If you have problems working on the floor and getting up, they\\'ll hold your weight easily and make getting off the floor a breeze (you don\\'t even have to be kneeling ON it to use it as a sturdy prop to stand up.)The other thing is that the device is folded up when you get it. To use it, you just open one \"leg,\" then the other. Some folks seem to have problems folding it back up (very easy to store.) To do this, look for the springs on each side. There is a metal bar that runs perpendicular to the springs. Grasp the bar AND the spring section and squeeze. It\\'s very resilient. You don\\'t have to force the two bars together, but just enough to loosen the knobs that click into place when you open the device. When you squeeze (and yes, it\\'s a bit hard if you\\'re a woman), push the arm down, and one half is folded. Do the same with the other side, and you\\'re done. (To open it, just open each arm. It locks into place with no effort.)You don\\'t have to be an AARP member to find this device to be incredibly useful. I bought two: one for indoors and one for outside stuff. I absolutely recommend it if you find that your glucosamine and chondroitin tablets are taking awhile to kick in with that knee pain!',\n",

       " \"Clog Proof I really like this bird feeder but not for the fact that squirrels can't get into it. I have two dogs that make sure that doesn't happen. Heck half the time they don't even let the birds on it. But I love it because I went out the other day and four of my six bird feeders looked fine and had seed in them but when I inspected them the seed mix had gotten wet and clumped up so it no longer would come out of the feeder. Not this feeder! The water can't get in to the seed area because the squirrel begone hood. This was the only feeder that was completely empty even though it was the newest edition and held the most seed. It's a hit with me, the birds, and maybe even the dogs!\",\n",
       " 'Squirrel-proof This is a study feeder, with a tube 4.5\" in diameter.  The seed comes out the bottom of the tube into a small tray that goes around the tube.  The birds can feed through 4 holes in a metal sleeve that is suspended by a spring from the bottom of the tube.The main selling points on bird feeders seems to be 1) How squirrel-proof is it, 2) how long will it last, and 3) how much does it cost?  I will add a 4th of my own requirements, and that is how deer-proof is it.  I have had deer come in Winter and tilt myPerky-Pet 7103-2 Copper Triple Tube Bird Feederfeeder and drain the whole thing in a night.  The hoof-prints in the snow gave them away.  ;-)So this feeder appears to be both squirrel- and deer-proof.  Tilting the feeder does lose some seed, but it does not flow out very easily, especially when the bottom part is pulled down like when a squirrel or deer is trying to get into it.  The top dome also tilts when weight is on it, which will certainly cause squirrels and chipmunks to slide off.  I think it\\'s a good design.How long will it last?  They claim a heavy-duty, powder coated finish, which I assume is over standard steel.  The spring inside the bottom part to make it tilt I assume is steel as well.  So this feeder will likely rust in maybe 5+ years, and once the spring rusts away, the bottom will fall off the tube - the spring is the only thing holding it on.  You will have to get a new spring from Perky Pet.  Aluminum or stainless steel would be better materials.How much does it cost?  This feed is on the expensive side, especially not knowing what materials it\\'s made of and how long it will last.  I would wait for a price-reduction from the list price.',\n",
       " 'Deters squirrels but has issues As a serious bird enthusiast, I have a fairly elaborate setup to attract them and have many.  This feeder seemed a good addition, but there are problems.  To begin with, when it arrived the black cap that covers the spring mechanism in the interior bottom of the feeder was loose in the box.  I don\\'t think it was supposed to be as the directions didn\\'t mention it and it was quite hard to reattach.  The feeder is really big, but not big enough for me to get my arm all the way down inside it to replace this part.  I finally got it placed by using a reacher/grabber gadget, but couldn\\'t get it pushed down firmly.  As a result I expect problems sooner or later.  Right now it\\'s working, though.The directions did show how to attach the pieces of the top, but I found it annoying that you can\\'t set the feeder down with both the lid and the dome pieces attached as they come apart.  I figured out that the dome shaped cover piece is supposed to stay hung at the location you\\'ve chosen and only the tube with its lid is to be removed from the underside hook for refilling.Regarding the refilling:  On the good side, the big open tube is easy to fill with most scoops and can accommodate a wide mouth funnel that further speeds filling and minimizes spilled seed.  On the down side, detaching and reattaching the lid is awkward since the tiny side wires of the lid have to fit into equally tiny holes pierced in the tube, and which aren\\'t easily visible since they are slightly recessed under the lid.  You have to squeeze the tube a bit to make it wide enough for the pins to get inside, then releasing it lets them seat if you have them in the correct position.  These holes are very near the top of the tube and should they break when the plastic is hard, during the winter, for example, the whole feeder becomes useless.  The whole weight of this feeder hangs on the two little holes in the plastic which are only about \" from the top of the tube. Only time will tell how long the feeder lasts and given the fact that one assumes squirrels will be jumping on it, trying to get at the seed, I have concerns.Another issue I have with the feeder is that the perches are very short.  So far only the tiniest birds have been able to feed from it, the chickadees and wrens.  Others may get the hang of it and I put the best no mess seed in it to encourage them.  I\\'ll just have to wait and see.I have several feeders, all of which are very sturdy and need to be. For one thing, they can easily tip over on the uneven gravel where I fill them, which I have to do as often every other day during heavy feeding times.  They are almost never without many birds vying for the best perch and suffer regular attacks from crows and squirrels.  Both these marauders mostly enjoyed the tray feeder as all the others are tube feeders and squirrel proof (not that they don\\'t get worked over).  I hated to have to remove the tray as some of the birds I most prize seeing prefer it, but the crows and squirrels drive me nuts.  So far this feeder has deterred both, which is a definite plus.Considering how expensive this feeder is, I expect it to do a good job at both satisfying my birds and deterring squirrels--and it has to last a long time.  I\\'ll update after an extended trial period.  I\\'ve only had it up a week at this point.  Maybe it will grow on me.Update 9/18/13:  I left my other feeders empty for a while so the birds would work harder to use this one and the finches and titmice have decided it\\'s okay.  The bigger birds still can\\'t get purchase, but at least it\\'s useful for the smaller ones.  It was easy to refill.  I feel a bit more positive toward it at this point.Update 10/12/13: Not feeling so positive anymore as the top broke off while refilling today making the feeder essentially useless because you can\\'t rehang it.  Some super glue might work to reattach the hanging wire to the lid.',\n",
       " \"Perky Pet Squirrel be gone bird feeder I probably would of given this a better score if the design of where the two little prongs are, was different. They support all the weight of this big bird feeder, and its heavy when filled...its good its a big one, filling less often interests me. BUT...the large plastic tube has two little holes drilled in it to have a little piece of metal stick into each hole to hold this, and I am thinking in time, just from the elements and the sun/heat that with taking this apart to fill, refill, etc the plastic will fatigue...then you have a very expensive bird feeder that the squirrels can't even TRY to get into anymore.To me the design of it and how it will probably not last too long is important as this is a pricy feeder. On the upside, it was easy to assemble. I was interested as to where it was made, it says its made in the USA of US and CHINA parts. Draw your own conclusions.\",\n",
       " 'Cost VS Practicality This is a decently made product, fairly sturdy and easy to put together. The nut holding the hook together seems to be too small and threaded incorrectly, but it appears to be holding together fairly well none-the-less.Squirrels still mange to use this product as their very own buffet, but they are not able to chow down as fast on the sun flower seeds I fill it with as they can with some other feeders. That is saving me from having to re-fill this as fast as I have had to fill some other supposedly \"squirrel proof feeders\".The mechanism on the bottom where the food come out is very clever in that it tilts and provides no way for the squirrel to hang on for more than a few moments before dropping to the ground. I am sure that given enough time, the squirrels will find a way to bypass this.What bothers me is the price. This is a fairly high end product for what it is. The only other feeders I\\'ve used that are in the same price range is byDroll Yankees YCPT-360 Tipper 4-Port Hanging Bird Feeder(although I am sure there are more expensive brands out there) and my Droll Yankee feeders have withstood the test of time. I\\'ve had some of them now for 6 or 7 years and they are still doing an outstanding job.If this product last even for three years it might be worth it, but the look and feel of the plastic makes me wonder if it can hold u to frigid winters, sharp beaks and claws and high winds without damage',\n",
       " \"Better options exist, but holds a lot of seed I also had the wrong-sized nut/bolt to tighten the baffle, so getting the top hook and baffle off and on to add seed has been a pain. I've been meaning to get another nut for it, but just haven't had time.Assembly is easy, though I have to admit, I didn't quite see how to get the top off an on initially. You have to kind-of squeeze the sides of the plastic tube to get the top off and I wonder how long that'll hold up before it cracks. It does seem to be very study plastic, but we'll see. I do have my doubts about two little metal prongs in two little plastic holes holding up to 3lbs. of seed for extended periods of time.This feeder holds a LOT of seed. The birds took to it immediately. To date, we have not seen any squirrels on it, nor try to access it.I currently have two other feeders from Droll Yankee with lifetime warranties and they are still holding up after six years. Based on this cost and the quality issue with the top nut/bolt, I think there are better options out there.\",\n",
       " 'Yes, It IS Squirrel Proof, BUT... Between the weight controlled port closure and the tilting and wobbling dome, this bird feeder certainly lives up to its claim of being squirrel proof, BUT it lets so much birdseed fall out of the bottom as the base tilts under the weight of even the tiniest bird that squirrels and large birds can gather up as much birdseed they wish.Probably not quite the solution to the problem you were looking for.Note: The bird feeder comes mostly assembled, and I made no attempt to check the already assembled parts.  After a month one of the perches somehow unscrewed itself and fell off.  I recovered the perch and the nut but could not find the locking washer.  If the locking washer was never there, that would readily explain how the perch came off, and when I checked the other three they were still tight.  So it might be worth a couple of minutes of your time checking that all four perches are screwed in tight when you first unpack it.',\n",
       " 'NO squirrel damage...but...NO BIRDS either It\\'s sturdy, a plus. It\\'s engineered to keep squirrels from damaging it and eating the feed. That works too. It\\'s attractive, another plus. Add that up and you get about 2 and a half stars.BUT...BUT...BUT...The design is not only unfriendly to the squirrels, but it is alsoBIRD UNFRIENDLY.I waited a long time, several weeks to review watching the feeder just off my patio where hangs several other feeders. During that time only one house finch ate from the feeder, only once. The design is not one that readily attracts birds. They have to discover where it is the feed is offered. It\\'s almost hidden unless they actually perch. They don\\'t want to do that.Other feeders with a mesh feed reservoir nearby were super actively being used at the same time this new feeder was ignored. So if it\\'s called a bird feeder and the birds don\\'t like the design, then that\\'s a giant multi-star negative. I can\\'t recommend this feeder over the other styles, even though it is strong enough to discourage the bushy tails. Less expensive feeders are not squirrel detracting, but for the price, perhaps could be replaced once or twice at a lesser price. And they will allow you to watch birds actually eating seeds.Bottom line: keep looking. I really wanted this feeder to work, but it will not be used much longer. I\\'m listening to the golden finches and chickadees who said \"No.\"',\n",
       " 'Large capacity feeder, not sure of some of the design features Update and downgrade. I\\'m downgrading this to two stars because the birds simply don\\'t like it. I\\'ve had it up or a long time now and it is surrounded by four other feeders that all do a brisk business. This feeder has the same seed and yet the birds try it once and then ignore it. I\\'m convinced the seed is simply too difficult to extract and so the bird give up. There are much better feeders on the market and I would start with any feeder from Droll Yankee such asDroll Yankees YF Flipper 4-Port Hanging Bird Feeder. Updated on 1/24/2014.I have a large \"feeder station\" outside of a picture window in my den and over the years I\\'ve tried a lot of feeder designs--some just because I was looking for the best made and best designed feeders and some because I wanted to defeat squirrels. I\\'m in Connecticut and there are lots of gray squirrels here and they are amazingly clever (and funny) when it comes to getting food from a bird feeder. And they are determined little creatures. I finally found a method to keep squirrels out of my feeders 100% of the time, and I\\'ll get to that at the end of this review. But I\\'m still willing to try new ideas and it would be fun to find a feeder that solves the squirrel issue all on its own. I\\'m not sure that this feeder does that, but time will tell.This is a larger feeder than I thought it was going to be-and that\\'s a pleasant surprise.  It also seems pretty well made, but I have some doubts about some of its construction features. Here are some pros & cons:Pros:*The dome on top and the lid look as though they\\'ll keep the food dry from rain or snow entering through the top of the feeder. Wet food can grow mold and that is very dangerous to birds.*As I said it\\'s a large-capacity feeder and  holds three pounds of seed. That\\'s pretty substantial, so I like that feature.*It was simple to assemble, all that  you really have to do is attach the lid at the top of the tube and then put the hanging loop (using a small nut) on the dome. Took less than two minutes to assemble everything. Unlike the Droll Yankee feeders that I use, the perches were already installed and that saves time. On many of the Droll Yankee feeders you have to tap them through holes in the plastic tube and that requires freezing the posts (to shrink them) and that\\'s a pain.*Overall it seems very well made, but with a bird feeder it often takes months and some severe weather to find its flaws--so I\\'ll update this review in a month or so.Cons:*First and foremost, I am not crazy about the way the base tilts down. The idea is that the squirrel will fall off (from its own weight tilting the base) but it appears to me that a squirrel could catch its paw in the feeding station opening if the base starts to tilt after he\\'s on the feeder. I\\'m not completely sure that that\\'s a possibility, but I was able to get my finger caught (gently) between the moving base and the stationery feeding tray. I certainly don\\'t want to look out and see a squirrel hanging by its paw. Again, the risk may be pretty low, but the way this is designed, the feeding perches are attached to a collar (that has holes through which the birds feed off of an interior tray) and that\\'s what moves. It\\'s easier to understand once you have the feeder in front of you.*Also, I prefer a feeder that has a catch tray underneath to catch the spilled seed. Instead, this tray has openings in the base so that food that falls off of the internal feeding tray falls out through slots in the bottom of the feeder (again, much easier to see when you have the feed in front of you).  The problem with food falling on the ground is that it brings rats and mice. When there is a catch try, the food gets eaten by the birds.*The tube seems a bit too flexible to me. The way that you mount the lid, for example, is to squeeze it a bit and slide in two prongs on the lid (the lid, not the dome, they are two separate things). It seems to me like the prongs could have been a tiny bit longer to keep it attached more securely--and also, every time you grab the tube, you squeeze it and the lid can pop off. Not a major flaw, it\\'s minor, but it\\'s an issue. The Droll Yankee feeders have a lid that slides up and down, you don\\'t have to remove it and it fits very securely. I\\'m not sure if the plastic tube on a Yankee feeder is thicker or not, they may be exactly the same.You might think that from the cons that I don\\'t like this feeder, but that\\'s not quite true. I am willing to keep it up for a while and see how it works, both in keeping squirrels away and in just feeding the birds. If I don\\'t see squirrels hanging by their paws or find a lot of food on the ground, I\\'ll be satisfied. As I said, I like the capacity and I think overall the feeder is made of quality materials. I just have some issues with design choices that had to be made in order to facilitate that tilting base. I will raise my review to four or five stars if the feeder proves itself. I really want to like this feeder partly because I like the capacity so much.OK, I said that I figured out how to keep squirrels off of your feeders and I have. I went to a bird feeding store and I bought a sort of kit that consists of a pole (plus a simple insert for putting the pole in the ground securely--it works beautifully) and a baffle that goes around the pole. Squirrels can only jump about 4\\' off the ground maximum--and I can verify that from years of playing with the height of the baffle. So if you place the baffle on the pole at 4\\' or so and IF there are no nearby trees or fences for them to jump from, they simply can\\'t get up the pole. I have a three-pronged hanger at the top of the feeder and I have three feeders on it: sunflower, suet and thistle. It works: in five years, not a single squirrel has reached the promised land.I don\\'t have this Perky-Pet feeder on that pole though because I want to see if it defeats the squirrels on its own. So I just hung it on a 4\\' pole (a shepherd\\'s hook) so that the base of the feeder is within the squirrel\\'s jumping range. It\\'s only been out a few days and the squirrels haven\\'t discovered it yet, but they will--and soon. I\\'ll try to keep a video camera handy and I\\'ll post a short video of my experiment if I catch a squirrel in action.I love squirrels, I find them very interesting--but I would much rather just watch birds without that extra havoc. I\\'ll post an update shortly.',\n",
       " \"Nice Feeder but Ridiculously Expensive We have some pretty fat squirrels in our yard that have managed to get into every bird feeder we have.  It has been about a summer month and I am actually surprised to say that we have not seen them eating out of this one.  We have seen them look and survey but we have not seen them even try to get on this one.  So far it has worked well to keep the squirrels at bay.  The two downsides to this feeder are that there are only four posts/holes for the birds to get to the seed so only one or maybe two birds will eat at one time.  The other downside is the ridiculous price.  At over 70 dollars one might as well invite the birds out to dinner and a movie.  I can't imagine how the manufacturer can justify the price for this thing.  The top and bottom are metal but the tube is just thin plastic.  How pissed would you be if you bought this filled and hanged it and it fell and cracked the tube?!\",\n",
       " 'Not Worth the Money! When I received this product, the bolt to tighten the baffler was not the correct size so I called the manufacturer. They were quick to respond and sent me a second whole bird feeder. The issue with the second one is that it was missing all of the hardware. Since I received this as part of the Vine program, I was not going to waste any more of my time trying to get this manufacturer to ship out the correct parts.We gerryrigged the baffler, but it makes removing it to put more seed in very laborious. So far after 2 weeks no birds. It does take awhile to get birds to a new feeder.Why the one star? Too expensive and the manufacturer has obvious problems with packaging. Not worth the time and money. Buy something for less money. A hint on keeping squirrels away from feeders is to remove any from areas where squirrels can jump to. We have six feeders and no squirrels. Now deer are another thing altogether!',\n",
       " 'Perky-Pet Squirrel-Be-Gone: \"The Baffler\" We have quite a few mature trees in our yard which provide an ideal place for bird feeders. Anyway that\\'s what I thought when we moved here. I hung several of the birdhouse style feeders and in no time the squirrels and chipmunks figured out how to scare the birds away and skillfully scatter their meal on the ground. I watched some even work in tandem to steal the bird food.Perky-Pet has recently released their latest in a line of anti-squirrel bird feeders. They call this one the Perky-Pet Squirrel-Be-Gone: The Baffler (Model 397). If you have ever observed a rodent at work, they are clever and persistent in their desire to secure food and housing for themselves. As you can probable see by the photo this bird feeder has a long clear plastic seed tube that makes up the body of the feeder and providing a visible place to store the bird seed. The bird feeder dimensions are 25 in. H x 11.7 in. W x 11.7 in. D; the seed tube is about 4 inches in diameter and will hold a substantial amount of seed, up to 3 pounds! Here is a promotional blurb I found on this product from Perky-Pet:\"Best Used For: Attracting and feeding birds without allowing squirrels to get the seed. This unique squirrel-proof feeder will increase your bird traffic while minimizing seed lost to squirrels.\"This feeder has an attractive shiny metal saucer-shaped lid (or as Perky-Pet calls it \"a dome\") that connects to the top of the plastic seed tube. There is a hole at the center of the saucer to connect the two parts and at the same time provides a place for a ring to be fastened on the top of the dome for hanging. The dome is part of this new squirrel-baffling bird feeder, along with a very cleverly designed metal base that comes already attached to the bottom of the seed tube. There are four holes (or ports) about the size of dime around the metal base right through the seed tube. These holes are the feeding ports. Small perches are also attached to the base in front of each feeding port and are made out of metal just like the base for durability. Considering the dimensions of the perches and the feeding ports this bird feeder is obviously made for small lightweight birds; No crows or pigeons allowed!Now let\\'s get to the patented weight-activated base and other features of this squirrel-baffling bird feeder. The smooth metal dome is not secured tightly to the top of the seed tube which allows it to wobble around when any weight is applied from above or below; like from a squirrel or large bird. According to Perky-Pet: \"The dome tilts and wobbles as well to throw squirrels off balance who try and land on the feeder.\" This also applies to those pesky crows that dominate our backyard in the mornings, scaring away the smaller birds we are trying to feed. Likewise, if weight is applied to the base, such as by a leaping squirrel, chipmunk or a large bird, the base swivels like a bucket under their weight, automatically closing off access to the feeder ports and preventing the loss of seed.There is very little assembly required. Perky-Pet has included an excellent sheet of instructions that are easy to follow and is written in English only. In fact, there are only two steps to complete assembly. All assembly applies to attaching the dome to the seed tube; everything else comes already assembled. During assembly one thing concerned me. The seed tube is plastic and there are two small holes on opposite sides to attach the dome to the seed tube by poking the ends of a metal bracket through the holes. This feeder is not light and once 3 pounds of birdseed is added it is quite heavy. In my opinion, this is the weakest link of the Perky-Pet bird feeder. In order to prevent a future disaster I decided to drill-out the small holes so I could insert a 2-piece hard rubber grommet into each new hole. This allowed me to still insert the metal bracket as designed while also providing reinforcement for the plastic seed tube. Only time will tell whether my modification will prolong the life of the feeder, or not.Perky-Pet has three short and informative videos on their website explaining (1) How the Squirrel-Be-Gone Baffler works, (2) Where to place your bird feeder and (3) Instructions for cleaning the feeder. You can Google the website by typing the following in your browser window: perky-pet squirrel-be-gone baffler model 397.I had originally intended to hang the bird feeder on one of my wrought iron shepherd staff hanging poles but decided not to when I realized the bottom of this 25-inch bird feeder would only be hanging about 3 feet off the ground; much too low and inviting for the numerous non-flying animals that roam around my backyard. After I watched the videos mentioned above I decided to relocate my bird feeder to a higher point and nearer to our birdbath; I also added a hook to the end of the metal strap I am now using to hang the feeder from a protruding galvanized metal pole mounted horizontally on the bottom roof line of a large shed in the backyard. I have to use a stepladder to hang and remove the bird feeder, but that is no problem. This product was built in the USA with both U.S. and Chinese parts. The label information on the front of the box is written in English, French and Spanish.Overall I am pleased with this new bird feeder. The squirrels and crows have tried to access the feeder without success so far; the wobble and tilt action has definitely kept them off guard. However, they are crafty and persistent animals and since there has been a minor amount of seed loss, mostly during the recent wind storm, the seed that did fall to the ground has kept them motivated to devise new ways to thwart the security measures built into this new Perky-Pet bird feeder.On the front of the box Perky-Pet added the following statement:\"Feeder base and dome tilt to baffle the squirrels and protect your bird seed! Birds feed undisturbed from 4 feeding ports.\"I think Perky-Pet is overreaching reasonable expectations for this product by expecting small birds to feed undisturbed. There is always some animal around my neighborhood looking for a free meal; either in the form of birdseed or in the shape of a bird. Though it would be nice, so far undisturbed feeding is not the norm around here.Otherwise, The Baffler has worked as promised. Since there are moving parts it stands to reason that some attention will be necessary in the future to ensure the mechanisms continue to wiggle, tilt and wobble. There is no mention about maintenance on the Perky-Pet website that I could find. Only time will tell how well this new feeder will work over the long haul. Since much of the Perky-Pet Squirrel-Be-Gone: The Baffler is manufactured with metal parts I expect my Perky-Pet bird feeder will outlast most if not all of the plastic and wooden bird feeders on the market. This bird feeder retails new for $73.99, which is a hefty price for what you are purchasing. I know you can shop around and buy this bird feeder for much less than that.',\n",
       " \"Perch legs are too short It's really almost too big a bird feeder and the perch legs are too short.  Only little birds can land on the legs and they're not likely to do so with such a massive feeder.  It's expensive, it's difficult to clean because of the way the lid attaches to the base. The feed holes are too small as well. I would pass on this; just too many negatives.\",\n",
       " \"Much bigger than I expected, worried about how long it will last I have this hanging outside for a month now, and I'm still waiting to see a squirrel fall off it. They don't seem interested in investigating it yet - perhaps the dome is doing its job of keeping the squirrel away from the perch. The perch is supposed to tilt when a squirrel clings on to it, both denying the squirrel access to the birdseed, as well as throwing it off balance and possibly off the feeder.The feeder comes with the top unassembled. My first problem with it came when I tried to assemble it. The nut provided did not hold the dome securely - when I put a light pressure (say, 2 pounds) on the dome, it will push the nut off the hook. I called customer support, who offered to replace the entire feeder. I decided to get a replacement nut from the hardware store instead. Strangely, I could not find a nut that fit exactly, with either metric or Imperial threading - so the problem might be with the threaded hook. However, two metric threaded nuts worked where 1 didn't.The reason why I'm worried about how long this will last is that the seed tube is made of plastic. Near the top, a metal rod goes through holes on either side of the tube. There's no reinforcement, and this being a rather large feeder, a lot of weight is being supported by a bit of plastic.There also doesn't look like a good way of disassembling the bottom of the feeder in order to wash it properly.I haven't yet seen a squirrel being thwarted by this yet, so I'll rate it based on my observation of it so far. I'll update the review when I have more information.\",\n",
       " \"Attractive, functional feeder - little birds love it This is an attractive looking, functional feeder and was easy to assemble. The only problem I had was that the unit shipped with the wrong size nut needed to secure the baffle to the hook. Nothing I had at home would fit properly either. I took the hook to my local hardware store and the correct nut is a metric size. Twenty cents later I had the correct part and was able to complete the assembly.I have had the feeder hanging in a tree for a few weeks now and the little birds love it. They took to it within a day or two. [It sometimes takes a week or so for the birds to find a new feeder. I have four other feeders in my yard so the regulars are used to finding food here.] The larger birds have trouble with the little perches. This keeps the Grackles and Starlings from emptying the feeder but it also discourages the Cardinals.The squirrels and chipmunks have not been able to get to the seed by climbing the feeder - however - there is a fair amount of spillage from the tray which ends up on the ground. The chipmunks are having a feast sitting underneath it. The additional of a seed catcher would be nice.The true test of a feeder is whether it will withstand a Midwest winter and ever hungrier squirrels as natural food supplies dwindle. Right now the squirrels aren't that interested. They are curious and jump on it, but don't try too hard. I'm also concerned about the sturdiness of the plastic and how well it will hold up when temperatures go below freezing. I will update as the seasons progress.\",\n",

       " 'Squirrelproof, waterproof, but not birdproof. My back yard is a haven for all sorts of wildlife- not just birds, but rabbits, squirrels, chipmunks and the occasional skunk. I choose plants that encourage wildlife, and I never use pesticides or herbicides. I\\'ve never had a bird feeder, though. I was always worried about the effects of artificially feeding birds, but I was recently reassured by a naturalist that birds get their food from a great many sources, and one more source really won\\'t make a difference. And so I ordered this feeder.Looking at the list price, you\\'d expect it to be a pretty hefty, solidly-built device. If you did, though, you\\'d be wrong. There are a couple of stampings, a molded base, a thin plastic tube, a couple of springs, some pieces of steel rod for perches... and that\\'s it. It comes mostly preassembled, requiring only that you attach the mounting ring at the top of the feeder. That piece did give me some concern, as the main thing supporting several pounds of seed and feeder is a skinny #6 screw. New, it has more than enough strength, but a few years outdoors might weaken it through corrosion.Filling the feeder is easy, although my first attempt resulted in a pound of birdseed scattered on my back porch. It was running out through the bottom of the feeder, and I couldn\\'t figure out why until I discovered a black plastic cap about an inch in diameter lying in the bottom of the box. It\\'s not shown in the wordless assembly instructions, but I managed to figure out that kit is supposed to close off the bottom of the seed chamber. It slips on to part of the molding that composes the inside of the base, with less than 1/2\" of overlap. The only thing really holding it in place is the weight of the birdseed in the tube. Once the level of the seed falls below this cap, it could easily become dislodged, and the seed inside could run out. I considered gluing it on but that would make it impossible to access the springs inside if they became unhooked or broke. Once I had this figured out, filling the feeder was easy enough, although I was also concerned that the tube is suspended by two very thin steel wires that are inserted in two small holes in the plastic tube. This also seems like a potential point of failure.  I hung the feeder under my maple tree, using a lightweight steel chain- something squirrels were unlikely to be able to chew though.That was several days ago, and since then we\\'ve had two heavy rainstorms, neither of which managed to get any water into the feeder. That\\'s good. I haven\\'t seen any squirrels try to get in, and I don\\'t see any seed spilled below the feeder- which suggests that perhaps the birds have yet to discover the feeder. It may well be that food is plentiful enough this time of year that the birds really are stressed enough to look for new food sources. I suspect that when cold weather comes, they might be a bit more motivated. I\\'ll be watching the feeder regularly between now and then (my home office has a clear view of the feeder) and I\\'ll update as the birds and squirrels discover the feeder. I\\'ll also update if any parts fail along the way.Update: A close inspection of the ground below shows evidence that the birds have indeed discovered the feeder, and it looks like the level of seed may have dropped a bit- I\\'m going to put a mark on the tube to monitor the level. No signs of squirrel activity.Update II: The birds have definitely discovered it. There isn\\'t too much wasted seed on he ground, but the level of seed has fallen least rabble, and I\\'ve observed several birds feeding on- and right now it looks like two robins are having a bit of a fight over who has priority on it. Still can\\'t give it any more than three stars, given the cost and construction, but it\\'s good to see that the birds are making use of it.Update III: The birds- or a combination of birds and other scavengers- are now consuming seed at a rate of two or three pounds a day from the feeder. I just refilled it, and  I noticed a good deal of seed on the ground as well. As I type this on my back porch, there are four small birds on the feeder, and about eight or nine scavenging seed on  the ground below.A this point I\\'m undecided as to whether I\\'ll keep filling the feeder, get another, smaller, feeder, or just discontinue feeding until winter. I\\'ll probably buy another 20 lb bag before I make up my mind.Followup: It\\'s now June, and the feeder has been hanging in my yard since last August. It doesn\\'t look any worse for the wear. There are no paint chips, no rust, no cracks in the plastic reservoir. In short, it looks pretty much the way it did when I hung it 10 months ago.  I\\'ve discovered a number of things since first hanging it, too. Most commercial seed mixes at the big box stores are full of milo, a seed that no bird appears to care for, although they\\'ll eat it in an emergency. The best deals are to be found at country feed stores, buying mixes or making your own. I use a mixture that\\'s mainly of black sunflower seed, some cracked corn, safflower seed, and occasionally some cracked peanuts. This has something for just about every bird found around here, and has drawn a much wider range of birds to my yard than I\\'ve seen in the past 27 years. I plan on adding a noter feeder or two, using different mixes in them feeders to get different birds, and maybe add a few birdhouses as well.July Update: I was working at one end of the yard when I heard a crash and turned just in time to see a squirrel sailing through the air after bouncing off the roof of the feeder. They still haven\\'t figured out a way in, but one or two of the smarter ones may have realized than sitting on the feeder and shaking it can dislodge seed do they can eat what falls to the ground below- see the photo.',\n",
       " 'The Good and The Not So Good There really is a lot to like about this bird feeder. I live in the Pacific Northwest in extreme Western Washington, and this is now one of 6 feeders that I have so YMMV (your mileage may vary).I have waited some time before adding this review to observe how my birds have adjusted to the feeder. It has taken some time, but they are, very slowly ,and very gradually, becoming more used to it and using it a bit more. The chickadees and the nut-hatches are finally responding and are feeding from the feeder with greater frequency. The slow start to use this feeder seems to be that in order to get to the seed the birds have to stick their heads into the openings, something many birds seem to be hesitant to do it seems.The Good:1.  Very well constructed with quality materials. This feeder will last a long time and, I think, will hold up to weather and use.2.  It performs as advertised, and it really does thwart squirrels, and for my location, raccoons as well.3.  The top also also has the added advantage of keeping the food more dry in wet conditions thanks to the overhang from the anti-squirrel proof curved top.The Not So Good:1.  Many of the birds seem very hesitant to use this feeder, as mentioned above it may be because they really hae to stick their head into the opening to get to the seed. I use a \"premium\" blend. Perhaps another sort of feed mix would be more attractive to them> I\\'m not sure since this blend has had them doing through 20#of seed in a week generally.2.  The level of seed has not gone down much in this feeder after nearly three weeks of use. The birds have been coming to the feeder a little more each day though, so I am cautiously hopeful. I hope that they will gradually become more accustomed to the feeder, but it is a slow process for them it seems.3.  I have not had such a slow response to any other feeder, and Perky Pets feeders have always been a favorite choice for me.So - you see that I don\\'t have a very solid positive answer for this feeder, nor can I say definitively that it does not work. Perhaps the species that you generally attract may make a difference?We attract chickadees, nuthatches, flickers, woodpeckers, various finches, cedar wax wings, juncos, doves, and a host of smaller birds. I have a year round population.I want to love this feeder because it really is made well, but at this point, about 3 weeks after purchase I have some reservations. I have seen an increase in use since I first put it up.',\n",
       " 'A Large, Sturdy Bird Feeder that Defeats Squirrels This is exactly the bird feeder I\\'ve been looking for. We have a serious problem with very \"intelligent\" squirrels. They\\'ve managed to get into every bird feeder I\\'ve used and ruined most of them. This feeder is sturdy. It also works to keep the squirrels off, at least so far. I hung it on a moderately high branch where it\\'s easy for me to fill and so far the birds have figured it out, but the squirrels are kept at bay. I hope this continues.The feeder can hold three pounds of seed. That, of course, depends on the type of see you use. This is another plus for me. We have a lot of birds here and the other feeders would run out after one or two days. So far this one has lasted a week.The price is rather high, although not all that much worse than the feeders in the stores in town, but if it keeps the squirrels away and lasts several seasons, it\\'s worth it. It\\'s certainly better than investing in a new bird feeder every year and having it ruined.',\n",
       " 'Good product, but I can\\'t justify the price Our last two birdfeeders have been smaller Perky-Pet models and they\\'ve been fine. Priced at about $20, and perfectly serviceable and bird-popular even if squirrels have easily solved them.So I wanted to see how Perky-Pet\\'s high-end \"squirrel-be-gone\" model would work. I did not pay for it, but got it free through the Amazon Vine review program.As a product it\\'s well-made and while I think a smart squirrel will still get some food out of it, I do think this will make it difficult for them. The way the food dispenser tilts and wobbles will make it very difficult for an animal to maintain a long grip. They\\'ll fall, and while they\\'ll come back, they\\'ll fall again.My other feeder, the squirrel could just hang out until I squirted him with water. This one will make them work much harder, and hopefully he gets tired of it and moves on.But is that worth $75? I just don\\'t see how. Bird seed\\'s not that expensive, so even if a squirrel does eat a bunch of seed, how long would it take for him to eat $50 worth of seed? However, I only deal with one smart squirrel - so if you\\'ve got several, then it\\'s a different issue. Still, the price seems high for what is basically a fun luxury item.This is a big feeder. I have the tallest shepherd\\'s crook, and this hangs down far enough to be difficult to see under the railings of my porch. Luckily, we can see two of the four portals even if it\\'s a little obstructed. The point is that this is a large 3-pound feeder, and will be a big change if you\\'re used to those smaller, cheaper versions.The size is matched with quality. This has some weight to it, and is not one of those cheap plastic models that seems to age very quickly. I think this model will have a longer useful life. I usually get rid of a feeder once a year, usually after winter, but I bet this one would last.Ultimately, while I like the product and I think it\\'s well-made and should live up to most of its claims, the price makes it so I can\\'t go above three stars. But - a $75 feeder that last 4-5 years is better than paying $20 for a new feeder after every winter. So IF this lasts 3-4 years I would have a different opinion.The birds use this fine - like any new feeder, took a few days, but once they got used to it they all sit there and eat all day.',\n",
       " 'large, but seems a little flimsy A rather large, mostly plastic feeder intended to deter squirrels.It\\'s larger than I expected, and flimsier.  The tube isn\\'t quite as rigid as I\\'d like, the top is attached by a single small bolt/nut, and the bottom is attached via a single spring.  I\\'m not sure how many seasons this construction will hold up through the variable, wet winters we have here in Maryland (frequent changes from cold to warmer).The unit arrives mostly assembled.  For storage, the top has to come off (since the top is a \"baffle\", it flops over in storage).  Since the feeding ports are only at the bottom of the feeder, I had to hang it a little higher than I had planned (so it was still visible from my ground floor windows).  Even so, I have to stand near the window to see the feeding ports.The large capacity means less refills are needed, but between lots of seed sitting out, and the design that seems will encourage seed to stick to the bottom of the feeder, I\\'m concerned I\\'ll get moldy seed and have to scrub this thing out more often than I like-- I prefer the kind where I can easily dump out the dregs without scrubbing or washing.The baffle is pretty garden-variety, and I\\'ve seen my squirrels handily climb over baffles like this one (it\\'s not particularly wide nor does it swing/swivel vary hard). The bottom design is innovative and seems like a squirrel clinging would cause the port nearest the squirrel to close, but the crafty little rodents may be able to twist their bodies to still get to the port on the other side.So far, the only birds who\\'ve discovered the feeder are chickadees who are trying to get seed from the ports but seem off-put by how far in they have to reach to do so.  That means at this point, I\\'m not sure how well the feeder works, since neither most of the birds nor my squirrels have discovered the new source of food.  I\\'m not sure if it\\'s the unusual feeder configuration (my usual feeder is a hanging platform with an anti-squirrel grid), or that the temperature fall has meant lots of other food options for the local fauna.  I\\'ll update once I get more activity, particularly of the furry kind.UPDATE: The chickadees figured it out first, and still are the ones who most like this feeder.  The tufted titmouses use it some also, but I haven\\'t seen any larger birds on this feeder.  The only squirrel observed was eating spilled seed under the feeder, rather than trying to get into the feeder.  One morning I found the feeder in pieces on the ground (nothing broken, the nut/bolt apparently came out of the hook), which might have been the result of a curious raccoon-- but reinforces my concerns about the feeder\\'s construction, so I\\'m maintaining the 3-star rating.For the time being, I like the idea of this feeder but am ambivalent about the design and durability, especially at this high price point.',\n",
       " \"Best for small seed, not whole sunflower seeds I have tried numerous supposedly squirrel-proof feeders over the years.  This is a pretty basic design.  The top keeps squirrels from crawling down fro the top (but they can still jump from nearby branches if not carefully placed).  The bottom is on a spring that closes when the weight of a bigger squirrel (grey) lands.  However, some smaller squirrels, like red, or chipmunks are too light to lower the bottom and can access the seed.These kind of feeders usually work well for a year or two, then get knocked down by deer or bear and the top gets chewed by something (probably the grey squirrels).  They do work pretty well until that time.I have had it hanging for nearly 6 months and have had very little bird interest.  I think it is because I primarily use black oil sunflower seed and they just don't come out well from this feeder.  The benefit of this is that squirrels and deer are not able to tip the seed out. The downside is that the birds also have trouble.  My other feeders are filled with birds and empty quickly.  This pretty much just sits there unless the other feeders are emptied.  I could switch to a seed mix, but the majority of that goes uneaten.  Safflower would probably work, but that isn't very popular in my area.I do think it is very hard to fill.  I had to add an s-hook between the feeder and top baffle to be able to hang it easily.  I won't buy another if a bear steals this.\",\n",
       " \"Squirrel proof but birds don't seem to like it either! We have several bird feeders outside our breakfast window and have had a terrible time with squirrels. Our feeders hang from a pergola-type structure build over the window and the squirrels climb up the sides of it and actually leap onto the feeders. I jumped at the chance to review this Perky-Pet Squirrel proof feeder. I have used Perky Pet products in the past (their hummingbird feeders are the best) and always been pleased with them. This bird feeder, however, has been a disappointment.First, the good news: It appears well constructed and it holds a lot of birdseed. It is fairly simple to put together and hang. I've had the feeder up almost one month now and I can report that yes, it is squirrel-proof. They have not been able to get to it.But now, for the bad news: the birds don't seem to like it either. I filled all 3 of our feeders, this one included, and while the other 2 older feeders were empty within days, this feeder still remains almost full of seeds after almost 4 weeks. I have seen birds perched at it but the feeder just isn't popular with them. I suspect that the openings near the base (where the birds have access to the food) isn't obvious to them and they have to stick their heads inside to actually get to the seed. Perhaps it is just sunflower seeds that don't do well in the feeder. I will plan to try another type of seed and ammend this review if there is a difference.\",\n",
       " 'Looks good but not completely effective The assembly is easy and the design is good but not perfect as it does not stop small chipmunks getting at it. But this feeder prevents squirrels from feeding on the seeds. I have used this over the past one month and we have few chipmunks in the yard to cause enough trouble at the feeder. When a squirrel jumps at the feeder, the metal dome tilts and wobbles to throw the critter off balance. The weight-activated base also tilts to close off the four feeding ports. The feeder is designed satisfactorily and the metal dome and feeding base is well constructed. The glossy heavy-duty powder coated finish protects the feeder from sun and rain. I have rated three stars for its quality and overall performance.1.Perky-Pet 336 Squirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder',\n",
       " \"Nice Looking Right out of the box - it does seem like good quality and looks to be nicely made.  It was easy to assemble, fill and hang.  I have had bird feeders before and even the ones that claim to be squirrel proof were broken into and essentially destroyed by my squirrels. I have it hanging on a shepherds hook and I haven't even seen a squirrel get near it. So far - so good.\",\n",
       " \"Made well but needs a 2.0 version I immediately found that the quality of this feeder is really good. The metal parts are thick and heavy and have a good coat of gloss paint. It comes almost fully assembled as all you need to do is put the top dome and the inner top cap on. So now for why I feel it needs a 2.0 version. First the clear plastic cylinder that holds the feed has two small drilled holes at the top that the inner cap clicks into with pins. I know that its just a matter of time before the holes start to crack and then split and no longer hold the pins. I think they need to reinforce those hole areas with something (i'll use some duct tape of something myself). The other problem and this may just be an oversight is that there is a nut that you use on the inside to fasten the dome/hook hanging knob. Well, that nut is bigger than the hook/screw and just falls off and doesn't secure the dome at all. I called the company and the telephone number on the instructions insert are wrong so I went to the website to verify. Once I got a person on the phone they were very polite, apologized for the bad part. They had initially told me to return the feeder to Amazon and get a new one since it was brand new. I had to mention that I was doing a review thru the Vine program and she immediately said it would be no problem to send out the one part to fix the issue. I also asked if anyone else had called about this issue and she said she hadn't heard anything but would mention it to the appropriate department.Squirrels are clever critters so i'm constantly changing/rotating out my feeders to try and keep them guessing. Some will still figure out a way, as most jump on it and hit it hard enough to make the seed fall out. Which is what I think will happen on this one but I don't think they can hang from it like a bat and eat from it. It is heavier than most feeders so be aware that it really needs a strong line or what ever you are hooking it on to. I did notice (and this may change in the future) The price is $72.00 on Amazon but on the Perky-Pet website its only $59.00 Its way too expensive for a bird feeder but it is made of good materials and sturdy. For me if it wasn't for the Amazon Vine program to get this, i'd pass on it because of the high price.\",\n",

No clogging, no squirrels, great design and super easy filling are the main things I really like about this feeder. If you don't mind the price, I would urge you to purchase this feeder.  It is undoubtedly my favorite feeder in my yard!Happy Feeding!\",\n",
       " \"Great to keep the squirrels out We have had all sorts of birdfeeders, but I have to say, for some reason the squirrels don't have anything to do with this one.

The squirrels can just take them apart if given enough time.I really can't tell you what it is about this one, but it does seem to work!\",\n",
       " \"Can Thwart Pesky Squirrels I hung this feeder in the same spot as another squirrel proof feeder that the squirrels never defeated but never stopped trying to vanquish it either.The squirrel-be-gone feeder is large with it's eventual weight determined by the type and amount of seed used to fill it. Listed capacity is three pounds, but we keep it half full to keep the weight down. Filled to capacity this feeder requires sturdy support.It is easy to assemble the feeder with the only challenging part the piece that hooks into the plastic tube. Filling the tube is no harder than filling any other feeder of this type though I found that using a funnel makes filling much easier and neater. The base and baffle are made of powder coated metal - I'm guessing aluminum because a magnet doesn't stick to it.Most importantly, does it keep the squirrels at bay? So far I'd have to say yes because mostly they don't even try to get into this feeder. Even if they could get past the baffle, the perches are too small for a squirrel to grasp securely. Even the Rodan-sized blackbirds in our yard have a difficult time getting food out of this feeder because the perches are too tiny for them also.A deer had mastered the other squirrel proof feeder and regularly emptied it. I don't think Bambi will be ever to get seed out of this feeder.Yes, I was also taken aback by the listed price for this feeder. Yet, the price has gone down at least five dollars since I first saw it posted, and on the day I'm writing this review it's on sale at the Perky-Pet site for 59 dollars. Those who have spent years battling the squirrels might not mind paying this much for a squirrel-proof feeder that actually works.UPDATE -  I filled the feeder to the top; it holds lots of seed. The next morning the feeder was completely empty. We suspect deer who have previously emptied our other feeders. Will have to monitor the situation.\",\n",
       " 'Expensive but works well The Perk Pet 397 is almost like the Cadillac of anti Squirrel Technology. The top baffle helps serve to \"baffle\" the enemy, while allowing some birds to maybe stop and perch on the edges... but, if they are too weighty, the baffle will tilt, kicking them off the top. Very few birds I\\'ve seen on the feeder have tried landing on the baffle, so it may not work as a perch anyway.Baffles are old hat in the battle against the Squirrel Invading Army, however, so Perky Pet has enlisted even further help. The perch section on the lower portion of the feeder is spring loaded, so that when something too heavy for the feeder touches down, the battle line is closed and the invasion repelled.Unlike the Droll Yankee, THE M1 Abrams in the Squirrel Invasion Prevention Army, is much more expensive than this model. I do not own one, but I can see how someone would want one if they have a bigger squirrel problem than just 2-3 of the little pains. This, of course, in no way justifies the cost of the Perky Pet 397, as $75 is a really expensive feeder. Sure, it works, but you better have a really bad squirrel issue to buy into this one in my opinion.Missing is the ability to adjust the sensitivity of the perch latch, though I\\'ve seen a few cardinals on ours, so I assume such birds wont be an issue and will still be able to feed.The feeder is easy to assemble and easy to fill. One thing to note, if you plan to fill this to capacity, ensure wherever you are hanging it has the ability to withstand the heavy load. This thing holds a lot of seed.Overall, I\\'m happy with the feeder and its squirrel thwarting capabilities. Where I struggle is the price. For $50 you can buy 2 baffles, one for above and one for below a regular feeder. Unless you give the little suckers a place to hang out between the 2 baffles, you pretty much succeed with squirrel immunity. If you want an all in one solution, have the ability to hang this with a full load of seed and just want to hang it and forget it, this is definitely not a bad solution to the Squirrel Invasion.',\n",

The birds have had no issues that prevented or made it difficult for them to eat at the feeder.While it is nicely made, easy to assemble etc. it is in no way worth $72!!!

We haven't had a bit of problems with squirrels, chipmunks or other pesky thieves stealing birdseed since I put the Perky-Pet Squirrel-Be Gone IV feeder out. At first I tried regular birdseed, but the birds didn't seem to care for it. They couldn't (or maybe just wouldn't) dig through the mix of seeds to find their favorites. After seeing the seed level not going down, I decided to swap out the seed for black oil sunflower seeds. The only birds to use it (and still very sparingly) are the goldfinches. Everything here still prefers the other feeders and will pretty much ignore this even when the other feeders stood empty for a few days.The feeder design itself is really interesting. It is large and holds a nice amount of seed (up to 3 pounds!), so you are not filling all the time. The cover is not attached to the feeder, but instead the feeder hooks to it, allowing the cover to wiggle and not let any creatures to sit comfortably on the top. The perches are attached to a free moving base that will tip and close off the food so any unwanted visitors cannot get to the food.This feeder really seems to work well, but my birds don't seem to like it. Maybe this winter will be different as food becomes more scarce.\",\n",
       " 'not the best Issues with the feeder:-the nut that is to secure the top hook to the cover is tiny in size and ill fitted to the size of the hook.  It was impossible to secure it, and thus the top wobbles a bit.-tube plastic, part holding the seeds, is a bit thin.  It has to be squeezed slightly in order for the 2 prongs that hold the top on to be inserted, which gives me concern it will not hold up well in windy conditions.-seeds (1/4 to 1/2 cup) fall out of the bottom when filling the container and/or anytime the feeder is set on a solid surface.-bottom portion wiggles around the tube, seems way to loose, maybe that is why so many seeds fall out.-It does hold a lot of seeds, but the rather flimsy construction and materials gives me pause for concern. Especially considering the entire thing is held together by 2 tiny prongs, one in each side of the tube top.observation:-only very small birds have room to land on the tiny perches-the holes to feed from are very small, and there is a gap between the opening and where the seeds actually are, so again, only a small bird head will fit inside the hole to reach the seeds.Opinion:For the price, currently $73 on Amazon, there are better, more sturdy options.

       " 'Way too hard to fill and the plastic quality does not reflect the cost. Simple assembly (two minutes worth) is required for this feeder.  The tube has two holes in the top into which you insert the  metal prongs on the roof (you cannot see this in the stock photos, as it is covered by the squirrel dome).  I have uploaded a photo of the top. The roof has a 2 inch  opening for seed and a bar across it, so that the baffle part can hook onto it.  To fill you have two choices, remove the top by slightly squeezing the plastic,  the plastic is flexible enough for this, but I am not sure if that is what it was designed for and am afraid that squeezing it may stress it.  Or you can try to pour the seed through the opening, which is not easy because the bar across the top tends to deflect the seed.  I really do not like this, especially because the tube itself tends to move around when you set it down due the spring loaded bottom designed to keep squirrels out.We have Abert squirrels (darling but clever things that look like koalas).  They are acrobatic and determined.  They do not seem to be able to access the feeder after a few days (and they usually do get into them quickly) but it remains to be seen if they will learn.  Birds do not seem to have a problem.This feeder is not worth the current price over seventy dollars.  The metal parts are a lot nicer than most birdfeeders, and the bottom works well but I feel that the design of the top is really lacking.  I am concerned about all the weight on the small prongs that stick out and filling it is a pain. The plastic part is also not much better than my 20 dollar feeder.  Filling it so annoying, that I cannot recommend it at all.  I have a couple of the Perky Pet 102 Squirrel Resistant feeders, (you can get three of those, with some money left over for the price of this one) that have multiple ports (which birds like) and which are MUCH easier to fill.  Squirrels can get a bit of food from them, but they do have to work a bit for it.  Try one of those first if squirrels are a pest.

Once it's on the window you have to wrestle the entire assembly off to refill, and then go through the tortuous process of remounting the suction cups.

Actually, the name of this product describes them perfectly &#8211; &#8220;Perfect Little Brush.&#8221;  I actually have three sets of these. I had originally purchased them specifically for cleaning our hummingbird feeders but found that they are extremely useful for so many different things.I use them to clean small kitchen appliances, detailing our cars, cleaning power tools and cleaning fishing reels and my target pistols.  They work quite well in any small and hard to get at area.  They are stout enough to get the job done, yet they are gentle enough to not damage the thing you are cleaning.If you have hummingbird feeders then these, or something like them, is almost a must.  Feeders need to be kept extremely clean and need to be cleaned often.  These perfect little brushes make our lives so much easier.  We have, at times, up to 12 feeders going and cleaning them is a major chore.The price here is very competitive to what we paid here locally...IF you have Amazon Prime and get the free shipping.  If you have to pay shipping you might want to see if you can purchase the locally.  We buy ours at a local wild bird store. Although I will say that if you keep any eye on these brushes here on Amazon you will find that the price changes quite often.All in all this is a great product and I do highly recommend it.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks',\n",
       " \"Cute little bottle brushes This set of three, multi-colored bottle brushes is perfect for cleaning hummingbird feeder ports and other small holes and places.  For example, I have reserved one to clean out the small spouts in my fountain which tend to clog with algae as the summer wears on.  Each brush is about 3.5 inches long, with a tapered head that begins at 1/8 inch and widens at the base to 1/4 inch.  The brushes can crush down to a much more narrow diameter than that, of course -- the width of the wires that hold the brushes, less than 1/16 of an inch.  The plastic handles are rigid, although they can accidentally be snapped in two with pressure.  The wired support of the brushes themselves is only slightly flexible; you won't be able to work these brushes around corners and inside the base of a feeder bottle.These are basically short, rigid, reusable pipe cleaners.  They are perfect for cleaning hummingbird feeder ports or any other job requiring those qualities.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann\",\n",

However, I am rating them strictly on their use and that does earn a five star rating. They fit perfectly into the openings in my hummingbird feeders and do the job well for which they are intended. Having three different colors is a handy feature for balancing out the use. A fine, if overpriced, product.',\n",
       " 'Good Brush And Price.....But Very Small This is a very well made brush that is good for feeder ports, especially hummingbird feeders.  So far for me it\\'s been tough enough that after several uses its still holding its shape, and without shedding.  I like it and feel it is well worth the price here on Amazon, (especially with the free shipping that is being offered at the time of this writing).  The only thing I feel I should make extra note of is its really small size.  It\\'s only 3 1/2\" long, which makes it kinda useless for anything but ports on feeders.  If you want to get down to the bottom of a tube feeder where it really gets nasty over time, you will need to pick up a long bottle brush.  Also, if you do buy this brush for use on feeder ports, I would toss the suggestion of keeping it around your sink for other uses that\\'s mentioned in the description.  You will be bringing in all kinds of bacteria from dirty feeders into your kitchen.  You can wash it well of course, but it\\'s still a better idea to either keep one of these strictly for other uses than feeders, or buy some other brush for your kitchen sink.

The clamp is very strong and the fixture easily clips on securely and holds the light in place. Other reviewers have mentioned the light gets hot. I disagree a bit, the light does get fairly warm but not too hot. I have the light 13&#34; from my Bonsai plant and the warmth is hardly felt.

The further away the light is placed, the wider the angle of light allowing for multiple plants under the light. I have several plants under it and they are all doing very well. I just put two screws into a stud on the wall and then hooked the clamp to the screws. I am very confident the light is secure.

Depending on how far away this lamp is from the plant, the effective radius is plenty enough (about 24\" from a foot away).  I use this over a germination set next to my bird cage, and my little dove gets some of that light as well.One thing about this that may be dangerous to other users:  the black hood that goes around the socket gets VERY HOT!

I do have a room with fairly large south facing windows but at 48North, there is not enough sunlight and not good intensity to keep much going without supplemental light.I bought two lights and they easily and securely clamped on to a window valance (bamboo).  Not only do they give the plants good light (I hope!) but they create a nice ambiance in the room which is also my office (self employed computer programmer).I had thought to buy a light bar and stand - actually 2 - and make some shelf tables, but the other item in my personal mix is that I often travel by motorhome - and I travel through the winter.  These lights will easily go along and allow me to take my little herb garden along.  The light bar/stand options would not have worked for travel.It is a not very expensive experiment.

       " \"No Flocks Of A Feather... I picked up some of this  mix last summer at a local agricultural center.  It's an old brand that is easy to find, and the price was right.  My first outing with it last summer was a total bust.  I mean I mixed the stuff, put it out in two nice clean feeders and saw nothing get attracted to it but ants and bees.  If any hummingbirds did bother to stop by and sample it, they were obviously disappointed for they never came back.  Personally I never eyed a single one hovering over it.  At first I thought that I may have gotten started with feeding them too late. I live in New England where we only get one species of hummer that comes this far north, (the ruby throated).  It's important to get your feeders up in early spring and then they will find it and remain loyal to you.  But this spring I was johnny on the spot with the feeders and the same no show was going on.  I decided to try another brand of mix after this last outing.  (I know you can make it at home easier and cheaper, but just not worth the mess and trouble to me. Just my opinion, but its stands).  I decided to try the Mills Brothers nectar after reading the positive reviews for it here on Amazon.  Within just a week of flushing the old feeders and putting in the Mills brand, I had two dedicated hummers dining regularly at my troth.  I love it. It's definitely a little pricier than this mix, but well worth it, trust me.  I don't really know if any other brand or home made mix would do the same trick as the Mills, but I don't really care.  I found something that's reasonably priced, easy to use, and the hummers love it so I am sticking with it.  In conclusion, I don't bother to get involved in the debate about this Perky Pet stuff being junk food or bad for the hummers.  Personally I think that a lot of folks get a little too excited and go overboard with the panic over additives and colorings etc.  My main disappointment and concern with this stuff is strictly limited to the hummers not liking it.  It may have something to do with my dismal results being that I am forced to only deal with one species of hummer here, but the end result is that this Perky Pet mix has been a complete failure for me, and the Mills Brothers a hit even this early on in the season. I have left a link to the Mills brand, and my recommendation is that you skip this stuff and go for what seems to really work...Mills Brothers Hummingbird Food 3-Ounce Packet, 3-Pack\",\n",

This is reason enough to not buy this product.  Buy a product without the dye.Better yet, just buy sugar.  Use 4 parts water and 1 part sugar.  Boil the water first and then add the sugar until dissolved.  You will save money and perhaps a hummingbird's life doing this versus buying dye tainted food.  Hummingbird food is only sugar with coloring.CAUTION.  DO NOT use artificial sweeteners or honey, use only sugar.  Honey and sugar substitutes will malnourish and quickly kill hummingbirds.

       " \"Perky Pet Original Instant Nectar - 2 pounds (6 packets) - Our hummingbirds like it - Came with feeder We recently purchased a new-to-us home in a nicely wooded area. Within a few weeks of moving in, we realized that there were more than a few hummingbirds around... about that same time, we came across unused (new-in-box) feeders while helping my mother clean her garage. This all seemed like the making of a fun hobby, and we have not been disappointed.one of them was a Perky Pet 8 ounce feeder (Perky-Pet 203CP Pinch Waist Glass 8-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder) and the boxed set she she came with one packet of this nectar, which we found to be easy to prepare (very nice, since we really only have a couple minutes to get-it-done as we head out to work early morning).We cleaned the dust off the feeders, loaded them with nectar... and then nothing really happened for the first few days.  Just as we began to feel a bit of disappointment, we were encouraged when we noticed that the fluid level dropped a bit.Following directions, we emptied and cleaned the feeder at week's end and then refilled it -- and that is when the nectar carnage really started! As week #2 of our feeder experience really got underway, the feeders emptied in about four days and we began to see hummingbirds coming and going at all times of the day. Guess the word got out!By the middle of the fourth week, the 16 ounce feeder was emptying every 2.5 days or so and the 8 ounce feeder in a day or two. We had wonderfully colored green, yellow, blue and kinda magenta hummingbirds flying around in singles and in pairs, and they are awesome to watch. They love this nectar, flying in to land on the feeder's perch and sipping until content, then buzzing right off. There were even times when hummers seemed to do a little battle for prime sitting position, with the 'winner' forcing the other one(s) to hover just a few inches away (im)patiently waiting for their tuns. Very interesting and beautiful to watch.It's November and night-time temperatures are dipping below freezing, and our hummingbirds seem to have migrated away now. Can't wait to get the feeders and nectar back out in the Spring and watch them frolic again.Highly recommended! Totally fascinating.\",\n",

Easy to handle. What else would you want? OK...so some people will be put off by the fact that it's electric. Big deal. Get yourself an extension cord. I have a lot that's 150 feet deep and it's no problem maneuvering this thing with a cord attached to it. As far as noise goes, this this is a bit noisy...but it's a leaf blower!!! What are you expecting? Silence? The nice thing about the noise is that it's more of a low roar instead of a high-pitched whining sound like my neighbor's blower (which drives my wife and me crazy). Now...about the vac feature. If you're looking for a heavy duty leaf vac/shredder, this ain't it. It does have a plastic impeller and you have to be careful not to suck up any rocks or thick sticks. In fact, this is my second one of these blowers. I had the first one for three years and had no problems with either the blower or vac part. Then my 10-year-old decided to see if it was powerful enough to suck up a small rock from the garden. Indeed, it was. But the rock broke the plastic impeller, and that was the end of it (man...what a horrible sound THAT made!). But is should show you something that I went right to Amazon and ordered the exact same blower to replace it. I may use this one mostly as a blower. I'll use the vac, but only to suck up stray leaves on the driveway and in hard to reach places. I honestly believe if you're looking to vac up big piles of leaves, a much more heavy duty piece of equipment is in order. But if you're looking for an excellent blower at an excellent price, which will do minor vacuuming of leaves, this unit is perfect. You really can't beat the price. At under $60.00, I don't think you'll find a better made, more powerful, well-built unit. This thing really blows!!!!\",\n",

I found it easier to let the bag lay on the ground instead of using the strap around the shoulder when vacuuming leaves.4. The Magnesium Impeller will fit on this unit.

I was going to mount it right away, but now have decided to run the plastic one until it breaks or wears, then switch to the magnesium one. It makes sense to do this, as the magnesium impeller is very light, yet this Super unit is 4 lbs less than the Ultra, which helps at the end of the day.\",\n",

       " \"Five seasons of mowing so far! I have had this mower for five seasons so far, during which I typically have to mow twice per week from March through October or even November.  In other words, this mower has seen lots of use, and it hasn't failed me.There are several reasons I love this mower:1)  I am allergic to gasoline, so I avoid using it as much as possible.  Therefore, it is extraordinarily helpful to have an electric mower that allows me to avoid yard-based gasoline-guzzling &#34;appliances&#34; completely.2) It is light-weight, so I can handle it on my own.3) The handle easily folds down so it takes up less room in storage during the winter,4) Because it is electric, I can flip it upside down to clean it out without worrying about spilling any toxic chemicals.5) It does a very good job cutting grass!  This is important in a mower!  It also does a good job mulching grass clippings.6) It can handle hills without any issue.7) It is easy to adjust the cutting height.  In fact, the cutting height can be adjusted with one hand, by moving the handl on the left side of the mower.8) It is QUIET!  This mower emits less than half the noise polution that a typical mower emits.  I could probably mow very early in the morning and not annoy my neighbors too much. :)9) It doesn't pollute the air the way gas-powered mowers do.10) It is easy to start, with no pulling, keys, or other obstacles.  Just plug this baby in, pull up on the little orange handle (on the main handle), and mow.  That's it!Using a cord can be annoying at times, but it is something to which I QUICKLY became accustomed, and I quickly set up my &#34;ballet routine&#34; of mowing while avoiding the cord.  It isn't that bad. :)\",\n",
       " \"Good little grass cutter..... I feel like I am vacuuming my lawn instead of cutting it, and the cord gets quite annoying to constantly move out of the way.  But as far as quality, cost (no gas) and quick startup, it's very good.  I would recommend if you can get past the cord getting in the way all the time....it definitely took me probably twice as long to cut the grass than it normally would with a gas mower just because of having to move the cord over and over again.  But it cut well, was very quiet.\",\n",
       " \"go midori . . . This is my first electric lawnmower, and so far, I absolutely love it.  It is smaller, quieter, lighter, cleaner, and more efficient than your typical gas mower, and there is no risk of throwing out your back trying to start it.  It is one of my best buys at Amazon.The mower was shipped in the original box, with the housing nicely supported by cardboard inserts to protect, and minimize vibration.  Remarkably, a single strip of clear tape held the cover down.  The mower is relatively easy to assemble, and does not require any hand tools.  The instruction manual is pretty thorough, except for a couple of parts related to assembly, where a little better description, and larger diagrams would help.  Although it is stated in the manual that `no lubrication is necessary', lubricating the bolts on the handle before assembly, and even finished metal parts like the handle, will help deter corrosion.  The springs in the power handle and grass guard, would also benefit from spray lubricant.Once assembled, the mower is ready for immediate use.  Favoring the right-handed majority, the power switch is on the right side.  The motor starts up smoothly, and is relatively quiet, even when running at full power.  The whooshing sound generated, probably isn't much louder than a large electric weedwacker.  Since the motor is near the ground, and enclosed by a green plastic cover, the sound doesn't carry too much.  Motor speed can be controlled using the throttle lever, though the mower is designed to be run at full throttle most of the time.The blade height is set using a lever located at the left rear wheel, and is adjustable in approximately half inch increments, from about one inch, to three and a half inches.  The motor on this mower is probably not strong enough to cut a heavy lawn with grass higher than say three inches down to the one inch level, without stalling.  Running a motor with the rotor locked, is not a good thing, so avoid trying to force your way through tough spots.  Cutting narrower strips of lawn is one option.  Or you may need to start with the blade at a higher level, and then drop it down to one inch on the second pass.  If there are just a few high spots, the old technique of raising the front of the mower, and cutting them down, and then going over the area again, might do the trick.  It sounds like a lot of work, but consider that an electric mower is much lighter and easier to maneuver.Grass will collect at the discharge area.  The spring-loaded plastic deflector has some deep depressions that get clogged with grass.  If you don't clean the area out it could promote corrosion of the spring.  There is a gap between the green plastic outer cover and the metal framing that also gets filled with grass.  Perhaps a hard rubber seal in this gap, would be a good idea.  In general, the design of this area could be improved.There is a plastic strip at the back of the mower to help block debris that might blow backwards.  It is quite soft and flexible, and because it is quite close to the ground, it gets bent around and scraped up.  Possibly if it were made of harder plastic, and raised up a bit, it may last longer.  The wheels look quite sturdy and durable, and according to the manual, the wheels require no lubrication.Besides the normal safety concerns when using any lawn mower, users of a cord and plug electric mower, need to develop an awareness of, and a system for handling, the power cord.  Avoiding any possibility of overrunning the cord should be a primary concern.  What is recommended is if possible, mowing outwards from the source of power.  That way, you can try and minimize the chances of crossing over the cord while mowing.  Running the cord over my right shoulder, keeps it from trailing directly on the ground, and helps me keep track of where the cord is.  The mower has provisions for attaching the cord, and when connected properly, there is almost no chance that the cord will become detached.If you have a very large lawn, or one with heavy thick grass, this mower may not have enough power, and you may need to look at one of Black and Decker's other electrics with more powerful motors.  This machine has no problems handling my 2000 square feet of lawn, and I am very pleased with my purchase.  Easily five stars for this baby.\",\n",

Used the electric mower until 2007, when I treated myself to a mow/blow/go gardner. I just stuck the machine out in the side yard and never touched it. In July 2008, I pulled it out to mow a newly planted lawn not covered by my mow/go guy. Plugged it in, and it started right away, try that with a gas mower. My new house has 2300 sf of front and back lawn, this mower just gobbles up that lawn. It does bog down in taller/thicker patches, hence only 4 stars. But it gives a nice clean cut.

       " \"Five star mower, one star switch & cord minder. This is truly a good mower. I bought my first Black & Decker electric mower in 1972 and used it as my only mower until 1994. It received normal use on a normal sized subdivision lot. I absolutely loved it.Then, I moved to places that had much more land and the use of such was impossible. For the last few years, I've lived where there is a combination of riding mower and walk-behind needed. My gasoline walk-behind developed problems that were going to cost more to fix than it was worth. So, I bought this one.It took just a few minutes to get the mower assembled and the handle adjusted. I sprayed the underside with vegetable oil and started using it. It works great. It is heavy enough to not bounce around on uneven ground, but is light enough to let an old man with back and leg problems to push it around.This has the same problem as the Black & Decker corded tiller - the cheap plastic flip-our power switch and the worthless (and unusable) cord minder. Using a 12-3 cord is necessary for the distance I have to go with this and it just won't fit into the mower as designed. It also requires holding onto the mower with your right hand 100% of the time, regardless of the direction being mowed and where the cord is. I'm working on plans to modify the whole switch/cord thing. What a shame that this needs done.Yes, this is still a 5 star mower. The height adjustment is very easily used. There is ample power. The grass catcher works well, as does the mulching feature. It is a snap to keep clean. And, again, the weight is just right. I really, really like this. It seems that they assigned the mower development to people who knew what they were doing and the switch/cord development to someone who had never used an electric lawn tool.\",\n",
       " 'Failed to work after first mow This mower hit a small rock on its first mission and that enough to break the unit and send it to the dump.',\n",
       " 'Reliable Moving to a smaller property back in 2003, I found myself no longer needing my riding mower. I looked at several options in the gas mower lineup. After talking to a couple of electric mower owners in my neighborhood, I went shopping at the local hardware store and brought home the earlier version of the Black & Decker MM875 Mower. Like other gas powered tool owners at that time, I seriously had my doubts. That changed after a few weeks use. I\\'m very surprised that after eight years, this mower is still up and running.Weighing in at 52 lbs, this 12 amp mower cuts a 19\" path in no time. With adjustable wheel heights ranging from 1.4\" to about 3.5\", it does a nice job. I like the one touch feature for wheel height adjustment. There\\'s no fuss and tightness to contend with. I don\\'t miss the noise of a gas powered motor. Unlike the newer version, my mower has a straight handle bar with a comfortable grip. The start handle is conveniently located on the right side and has a good feel to it. Other then that, there\\'s really not that much of a change from the original.This mower is light and easy to maneuver around bushes and trees.  It does an average job of mulching. Mine came with the side discharge chute. The rear bag that now comes with the newer units was an optional purchase back in 2003. Even though I don\\'t use it much, the folding handle is a nice add on for owners with tight spaces. As far as power cords go, I picked up a good 100 foot length 14/3 gauge outdoor extension cord. Its not that hard to manage the extension cord. When using any power tool, its all about staying alert.Like any piece of gear, proper maintenance is paramount. Prior to using this or any mower, its a good idea to coat the undercarriage with a non stick spray. I use the generic grilling spray on mine. I give the blades a good coating too. Since the body isn\\'t metal, I use a rubber spatula to remove any buildup. Afterwards, a good wipe down. Its a good idea to inspect the bolts, nuts and screws for tightness after each use. Just like gas powered mowers, it does take a little bit of effort to remove and replace or sharpen the blade. I always sharpen my blade before the start of the mowing season and every other month. When sharpening the blade I use a fine tooth file. It can be sharpened with a good stone too. I got about 5 years out of one blade.Besides replacing the blade the back flap needed some help too. The original flap lasted me about 7 years and wasn\\'t that difficult to remove and replace. Protection wise, Black & Decker offers a two year limited warranty on the mower and a lifetime package on the mower deck. I\\'ve not used their toll free customer support number for the mower, but I have for other Black & Decker products. The customer service that I did receive was outstanding.Overall, I am very satisfied with my Black & Decker mower. It has been a reliable lawn tool that quietly and efficiently gets the job done. With proper maintenance I expect to get another eight more years out of this one. In closing, I can honestly say that I don\\'t miss my old gas mowers one bit.',\n",
       " 'Works well - would be better with push assist. This mower works great with small lawns that have minimal obstructions between the electric outlet and the desired mowing area.  The only way they could make this mower better is if it was push assisted.',\n",
       " 'Powerful and works like a champ I\\'ve had this mower now for 3 seasons. And every time I fire it up, I recall the days of having to maintain an internal combustion engine. You don\\'t have to change oil. You don\\'t have to check spark plugs. You don\\'t have to run the mower dry for over wintering. The only real maintenance we\\'ve had done is to sharpen the blades, and we did that last year with no fuss. That\\'s it. Maintenance is blade sharpening. This saves me time and effort.Then there is the quality of life change as well. No more stinky clothes or hair from spent gasoline. No more deafening roar when I run the engine. Yes, the engine makes noise, but this electric mower must be an order of magnitude quieter. My fiance doesn\\'t have to yell at me while mowing if she needs my attention, just speak in a louder voice.The mower is LIGHT. Sure, 50 lbs is unwieldy if you are carrying a package or something, but pushing 50 lbs around your yard? LIGHT.And then there is the one touch, single point height adjustment. Holy COW, this is just fantastic! Gone are the days where you have to adjust horrible levers, one per wheel, to get the proper height. Sure, newer mowers offer this capability and aren\\'t corded, but coming from one that had 4 wheel painful adjustment, this is a dream come true.There are downsides to this mower. One is power. 12 amps has been enough, for the most part, to mow our lawn. In deep (5\") and wet grass, it starts strong but if you don\\'t slow down, the engine will work itself to a stall of sorts. This is NO different than what we had with the electric mower though. I can\\'t believe just how much power this thing really does have.Another problem is the power cord. First, make sure your house has an external power plug, otherwise you\\'ll have to fish the extension cords out the window. And that\\'s where the real annoyance to this mower lies, the power cord. Whereas with a regular mower you can just mow, mow, mow, with this one, you have to mow... be careful... mow. The cord will get in your way. The trick is to plan out the mowing in a way that will always keep the cord in the MOWED section of your lawn (not so easy with the first push, obviously). If you do this, cord maintenance is a non-issue mostly. If you have trees in your yard to mow around, this WILL be annoying, no doubt. If that is the case, you may want to invest instead in one with a battery (this mower does NOT have a battery, it MUST be plugged in). Or, if those aren\\'t rated 12 amps or higher for power, I\\'d recommend the old standard internal combustion style mower.Highly recommended if you don\\'t mind power cord maintenance.Pros:Quiet (compared to regular engine mowers)No gas smell on clothes, hair, bodyLightPowerfulSingle, easy point to adjust heightCons:CordCordCordCan give impression of not being powerful',\n",
       " \"Oh yes! I originally chose a more expensive knee pad, ignoring these because of the single strap. However, when the ones  I ordered didn't work right, I came back to these. The other Fiskars products I have purchased have been very nice.When I first put them on I fastened the strap across the crease behind my knee and it cut into me. Immediate pain. However, I found it easy to adjust the strap below my knee (which actually pulls the cup into place better) and even crawling around, the straps stayed away from that painful spot.I will be using these for both gardening and crawling on cement under our home to replace the filter on the heater, so I am extra pleased with the waterproof nature of them.  They fit me nicely, and once I adjusted the strap, very comfortably. The cup shape keeps them from slipping to the side.\",\n",
       " \"Comfortable, good fit, easy to adjust,easy to clean I do a lot of my gardening on my knees as I find it easier on my bad back. Until I purchased Fiskars Kneelers Knee Pads I used a pad that I knelt on.  The problem with the pad, of course, is that you have to get up before moving to a new spot.  It is much easier to garden with the knee pads attached to your legs.  I am very pleased with this purchase.I am attaching a photo under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review.The photo shows both sides of the knee pads.  The top image shows the outer shell of the pad that touches the ground. It is made out of thick (slight under 1/2 inch) rubberized material which provides cushioning and protection from moisture.The bottom image show the inside part of the knee pad, which is made with soft black non-slippery material.  The cavity of the knee pad is 4.75 inches wide, and 7 inches long. It can be made more narrow by tightening the knee straps or wider by pressing on it with the knee because it flexes.Each knee pad has a rubber band which holds the knee pad to the leg. Each band is 20 inches long and 1.5 inches wide.  At each end of the rubber band there is 3.5 inches of Velcro so you can adjust the pad based on the size of your leg.  If your legs are particularly skinny you can sew in additional Velcro strip so you can close it tighter.  If your legs are thicker you can add another piece of rubber band with more Velcro.  I consider myself an average size woman and I got a perfect fit with and without long pants on.The knee pads are easy to clean by washing them with a hose.  They are solidly made and feel like a good quality item.Fiskars offers lifetime warranty for the knee pads.  Even if when I don't plan  on using a warranty replacement, it always makes me feel good about a product when the company shows the confidence in the product by offering such long warranty.  For warranty service, email warranty@fiskars.com or call 1-866-348-5661 or contact Fiskars Brands, Inc. 2537 Daniels Street, Madison, WI 53718.I am really enjoying my knee pads, in particular because I can move so much easier with them than a knee pad I used before.

I have bony knees, and gardening and housework really bruise them.Now I just strap on the pads and don't worry about it.The only thing is that the backing on the foam pads is peeling away, a little. So they're not the sturdiest pads ever. Maybe now that I know I'll use them often, I'll buy a higher-end pair and relegate these to the camping bins.\",\n",

These are light-weight and comfortable in that binding area behind the knee:  Perfect for kneeling to do work in your garden.  As a gardener, with several veggie gardens and plenty of shrubs and rose bushes spread over an acre and a half, these knee pads are perfect.  Both my husband and I have a pair.

For the former, they work great-  they don't add any weight to me as I walk around and go up and down ladders, etc.  I can get on the floor and paint near the baseboard while on my knees.  It's great.  My knees aren't the best and these help a lot!  For the latter reason, they're great too!  I can quickly get these on and then let one or two (or three!) of my plentiful and beligerent nieces and nephews ride on my back around the house!  Good excercise and quite tiring!  But for the price - you can't go wrong.\",\n",

       " \"Built To Last. I made the huge mistake of buying a cheap $2 trowel from my local HD, of course, it literally snapped at the handle while doing some light digging.The Fiskars trowel on the other hand, is built to last. I couldn't really tell from the pictures, but once I inspected and held it, I could feel the quality and after testing it, I noticed a huge difference, the way it handles dirt/soil and the little work it takes to dig, is simply great.What I like the most is the design, the handle is a  solid metal piece, thick and extremely durable. It didn't bend while digging and it felt very comfortable. The handle is wrapped in a rubberized sleeve which happens to be very ergonomic.Nothing much to say really. This is great gardening tool that I'm sure will last.\",\n",

Although its used mostly for troweling, it's  narrow enough to be used for planting and broad enough for transplanting.  I have a tool for every job but I find this is the only digging tool I really need to bring along.  If you're debating which type of  hand digger to get (planter, transplanter, troweler, etc.), I would stick with this trowelerThe handle is very comfortable, important when jabbing it into the ground repeatedly to loosen the soil.  The wooden tools I've used in the past have been very hard on my hands but, I come away with no pain with this design.The polished alumnium is VERY strong, light weight, mostly scratch resistant and does not rust.  The textured material on the handle does collect dirt and has to be scrubbed to get clean.\",\n",

       " \"Nicely done, but a couple of improvement could be made This is a very convenient way to keep all your gardening tools handy. It's similar to the bucket tool caddies that contractors used with one key different -- there's no flap that goes inside the bucket, so it's possible to use the bucket to carry dirt, weeds, plants, etc. without getting dirt all over the caddy.Construction is decent. I had no problems fitting it to a five gallon bucket, but it's essential that you find one that does not have a lot of ribs around the lip. The caddy straps on with velcro, and the ribs would make it hard to get a good fit. Thus, buckets you buy at places like Home Depot will not work well - you need an old 5 gallon paint bucket for best results.There are plenty of pockets. The pockets on one side are closed at the bottom; the pockets on the other are open on the bottom. Chances are you'll be able to fit all the tools you want to carry. The only problems I encountered were with long handled weeders. I'll end up carrying them inside the bucket as before.The seed pocket (sort of like a wallet with cutouts to stash seed packets) is a nice touch but, alas, one that I can't use since I purchase most seeds in bulk bags not envelopes. Wish there was an option to remove that and replace it with a pocket suited for tools, but hey - at this price, I can't complain at all.My only concern is construction. While it is decent for the price paid, I expect it will be a bit ragged after significant use. Reenforced seams with rivets would be great - I'd be willing to pay a bit more for that. A better gripping mechanism would also be a nice touch - perhaps some type of spring clamp that grips the bucket so the burden of holding this on is not born by just a single piece of velcro. Lastly, a built-in sheath for a garden knife would be an excellent addition.\",\n",

While it's not made of heavy-duty canvas like the $60 models, it's strong enough for every day use, and it can last through several buckets.

       " 'I love my garden bucket caddy! I am relatively new to gardening and only had 2 old, cheap tools that I used to pot indoor plants. When I started vegetable container gardening, I quickly found that my old tools were not going to cut it, so I got myself a nice set of Fiskars tools. I then needed something to hold them and carry them in when I went back and forth to the garden, so I found this bucket caddy.I already had 5-gallon buckets as that is what I use for container gardening. It is tricky getting the caddy on right the first time. I found it easiest to lift the handle of the bucket up and then put the caddy on, being sure to align the openings on both sides of the caddy with the sides of the bucket where the handle connects. If you don\\'t do this, you won\\'t be able to use the bucket\\'s handle, which kind of defeats the purpose of being able to carry your tools to the garden! Even after going through this process a few times, I still haven\\'t mastered it, but I did at least get a tight fit of the caddy\\'s \"belt\" onto the rim of the bucket. The handle is pretty much locked in the upright position, but that\\'s okay with me because it makes it easier to grab it and go to the garden.There are loads of pockets of all sizes. They fit everything from my big round composite soil scoop (Fiskars 7068 Composite Soil Scoop) to a small pair of scissors I use for opening bags of soil and such. The caddy fits my Fiskars garden tools set plus several extra tools and there is still plenty of room for more.The material the caddy is made from appears quite heavy duty but, since mine is still pretty new, I can\\'t speak yet to how well it will hold up over time.You might want to complete your bucket and caddy with a bucket seat (Custom LeatherCraft 1140 EasySeat Lightweight Plastic Bucket Seat for 3 1/2- 5 Gallon Buckets), as I did. I had hoped for it to be more flexible for comfort, but it is still great to be able to sit on the bucket and have your tools right under you so you can both reach for whatever you need and also easily put away what you\\'re done with.Definitely recommend this Garden Bucket Caddy.',\n",

       " \"I should have read the description more closely... ...I thought this was a canvas bucket with a handle and didn't realize it was a canvas wrap around for a 5 gallon 'homer' bucket, which is not included.Tip for putting it on, unlatch the velcro strap and remove it entirely so you can slip the wrap under the bucket handle, not over it.  That might be why some people are having the velcro or seams tear, if you wrap it right around the handle and then raise the handle, that would put more stress on the strap.Once I wound this under the handles as pictured in the amazon image on the product page, rerun the strap and secured the velcro it was snug enough to put a bunch of tools in the pockets.  Which are big enough for tools you'd use to manicure plants, as opposed to hand shovels and the like.  Look at the photo and you'll see some regular standard scissors in one of the pockets, that should give you some scale.So nice that I have a big bucket to put stuff in, not so nice that its really made for rather small tools, not so nice that I had to go buy a bucket but that's my fault.  I own a ton of fiskars stuff and although I know their big business is scissors, I thought I was buying a yard tool caddy and not a scissors holder.I re-purposed it as a sprinkler/irrigation repair bucket, that's working for me.\",\n",

So, one day we had beautiful, healthy blossoms on our newly planted flowers and the next all we had were stumps and a few small leaves left on each. Talk about being sad!After a relatively detailed review and possibilities, we decided on the Scarecrow. We ordered one and two days later via Amazon Prime it was assembled, in the ground and hooked up to the hose. Aside from inadvertently squirting myself a couple of times, I got used to sneaking up on it to turn in off in the early AM and on in the PM. After a few days I got the sensitivity right and for a week have not had any problems with deer.Convinced that the Scarecrow was the device for me, I then purchased a Gilmour 13 Brass 2-Way Connector for the faucet and an Orbit 62001 Lawn and Garden Digital Watering Timer. I'll have reviewed both of these separately.Suffice to say, I am extremely happy with the Scarecrow.

I could hear them scratching and squirming in the little den of theirs, which used to be part of my house.  I tried a \"coyote urine\" repellent  - without success.  I decided to give this Contech ScareCrow a try.  I erected it in front of the den entrance and turned it on just before midnight, when I was sure all the raccoons had left their den.  An hour later, it fired and I heard the sound of animal running away.  All was quiet afterwards.  The next day, I spent all day erecting another barricade - a much sturdier one this time, with grade A \" lumber, 1/4\" steel screws, and \" steel nuts and bolts.  I left the ScareCrow where it was, just for good measure.  During the week, the Scarecrow fired a couple of times during the night and that was it.  The raccoons never returned to attack the barricade again.The nature of and solution to animal problems vary extensively, but for the narrow purpose of keeping raccoons from getting into their den, this Contech ScareCrow passed with flying colors.  The whole unit is made of plastic; it may not last very long under the hot desert sun of the American Southwest, but it did work as it was supposed to right out of the box and setting it up was a breeze.  Other reviewers complained about short battery life; perhaps a lithium 9V battery may help.',\n",
       " \"Off limits! Cats just love nice soft planting bed dirt. Easy digging, no grass or leaves to work around and often plenty of room so they don't have to re-visit the same spot. They are indeed tidy animals. After preparing them for this year's planting, adding all sorts of expensive amendments, every day saw new cat diggings and poop. This year the beds are off limits.Set up the Scarecrow and not one cat visit to report yet. Well, they might of visited, but they didn't stay! I know it fired off at least once and while the water goes up some and doesn't actually hit them, it does make a sudden and fearsome noise and a lot of commotion and they want no part of that.Once I saw a mountain lion paw mark in one of my beds, so if it chases them away that might also be a good thing. Same for raccoons at the fish pond. And it does all this humanely.You do have to be careful to set the sensor low enough for cats and smaller animals. In the past I tilted a Scarecrow down so the sensor picked them up, but for deer or larger dogs you don't have to. With a raised bed it is easy to set up the height to just above ground level, but for a bed at ground level you might want to try setting it in a pit. You can't lean it over because it works by tracking animals walking across its path.It does not work on critters coming straight at or away from it. My outdoor motion lights are like that. You have to spend the time to find out the direction your visitors will travel and make sure they go across its path.The kick of the water will indeed knock it back so that it is pointed upward and this will make it useless. Really, you just have to attach it to a supporting post. I wired mine to the planter walls. I had one once that I put into a pot full of gravel and that did not work. Normal soil will not contain it either.So, spend the time to point it correctly and secure it. I find that going up half-way on the sensitivity works fine. You just have to test your situation (with the water off).You need a 9V battery as it does not ship with one.Years ago I had what seems to be the same device, a gift. It broke and the company would not answer an email about buying the part (solenoid). I hope things have changed and parts will be available. I do not like throwing away a $50 item that can be easily fixed.Hecho en China of course. Should be cheaper considering. Lost a star for that.\",\n",
       " \"Pretty useless for skunks I bought three of these to keep a local skunk out of our lawn before he/she manages to dig out all the grass.The PIR sensors inside the scarecrow barely detect a skunk - it's too low and slow to set it off unless its within a few feet of the sensor. However, the sensors do a great job of picking me up to 20' away. When an object is close, the water won't hit it, even on minimum range settings. What few drops are hitting the skunk, he/she simply shrugs off and keeps digging / eating.This 'scarecrow' works better repelling squirrels since they seem to set it off more easily (hopping through the grass) and because they seem to mind the water more.I like how the sprinkler head can be adjusted for range and scope of rotation (360 degree vs. a smaller sector, etc.). That allows you, within limits, to fine tune the area of coverage. The smaller the area of coverage, the more effective the scarecrow is, since the pest will be hit repeatedly as the stream whisks back and forth in a narrow arc. But that only works for alleys or other narrow confined approaches, not a open field.Another nice feature is how you can daisy-chain these scarecrows. The bottom has an inlet and and outlet that is usually covered with a cap. They even include sealing rings, so there is no leakage. However, I am not impressed with everything being made of plastic. The thing is fragile, as emphasized in the manual - no pushing, pulling, etc. on anything plastic other than the stake and then only around the garden hose fittings. For example, I accidentally dragged a hose across the top of one unit and the plastic distance dial popped right off.For $50+ I expect better and its claimed efficacy re: skunks is not borne out in my experience.\",\n",
       " 'With these modifications it works I grow a lot of my own food and I keep a straw mulch of 12\" on top of the soil.  I also have five cats who love to play in the mulch; moving the mulch around - revealing the seeds to the sun or they go to the bathroom in it.  Was looking for an inexpensive way to keep them out. Electric fence will work but is time consuming and somewhat costly..When I put it up, using all the parts, it is way too high to detect cats. Not only that I couldn\\'t get the water to spray down where it would actually hit the cats.  If you look at the picture above, the spray is \"above\" the cat.  That won\\'t work with my cats - they\\'d just thumb their noses at it and continue on their way.  This thing has to soak them or they aren\\'t going to leave the garden. So after fiddling with it for awhile, I finally stuck a piece off of a wooden clothespin in between the dial and the deflector and that got the spray closer to the ground.  But the whole thing is still too high.So I checked to see if a 1/2\" pvc hose thread fitting would work with the Scarecrow fittings and it did so I cut the long extension pipe down to size.  But they\\'ve made the pipe itself not a standard size - too big for 1/2\" pvc, too little for 3/4\" (what kind of company does that?).  So I sit there and scratch my head - looks like I will have to buy another extension pipe from the company.  But as I was walking by I looked at it and thought \"Now why can\\'t I just screw the hose into the fitting where the hose attaches, then screw that directly into the motion sensor head.Eureka!  Victory.  So now the Scarecrow sits about 6 inches off the ground.However, there is still another problem with the design of this product.  The hose attachment piece does not have a swivel.  So unless you put a disconnect fitting on it you are going to have to uproot the scarecrow to be able to get the hose off easily.If I were the owner of this company I would include additional length extensions in different lengths and a swivel hose connector.  A good idea this product; but needs more forethought by the designers.  Afterall, this product isn\\'t inexpensive really, especially if you need multiple ones.',\n",

       " \"Good Product With Excellent Customer Service We bought two of these scarecrows several years ago and have used them continually ever since. Deer are a major problem in this area. Forget deer resistant plants, they will eat almost anything when they are hungry. What they don't eat, they destroy, pulling it up and spitting it out! We tried several chemicals including wild animal urine, without success. On the recommendation of a local landscaper we purchased the scarecrows and they really worked! They protected even the most tender (delicious) plants.After the warranty expired, a big buck, escaping the spray, stepped on a scarecrow and broke the spray head. I called the factory, (phone number and e-mail on the included brochure) and they promptly sent a reasonably priced replacement.Recently, after six years of use, one unit was still working normally, but the other started spraying with a very small flow. I was prepared to buy a new one as we had several new tender plants that needed protection and I still needed both. However, I first tried again calling the phone number on the brochure, to my surprise it still worked! I talked with a very polite gentleman who suggested I try disassembling the unit and thoroughly cleaning the parts with a vinegar solution, he would e-mail the instructions. He did, and I cleaned it following the very clear (with pictures) instructions. It wasn't that hard and the scarecrow worked like new! The scarecrows were initially expensive, but they are still doing the job and have been well worth the cost.\",\n",
       " \"Scarecrow solved a cat problem for me! My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules, citrus sprays, commercial pest repellants, or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running, the cat came by, got blasted with it twice from about 15' away, and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard, but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!\",\n",
       " \"Gets the cat every time! There is a cat in our neighborhood that used to spend most of his day in my backyard hiding near my birdfeeders. Before I got five of these sprinklers, he was killing several birds a day.  In the seven months I've had the rainbirds scattered around my backyard, he hasn't had a successful hunt.  Nor has he been able to spend enough time in my backyard to leave presents for my dog to find.  The sprinklers do not react to birds, but the cat hasn't figured out a way to avoid them. Each time he moves out from under a bush, he gets blasted by a rainbird.  He jumps the fence and runs away only to return the next day hoping for a different outcome. When I first installed them I had a problem with leaks, but after wrapping the connectors with plumbers tape, there have been no drips whatsoever.  I like that the water jet can be aimed high or low, so my windows remain dry when the sprinkler goes off. The water jet is pretty powerful and very loud, so be sure to direct each rainbird so you can sneak up behind it to turn it off.  Even when the water is turned off at the spigot, enough remains in the hose to give you a good soaking.  Embarrassing to admit, but both my gardener and I have been sprayed more than once. This is a solid 5-star product, but you'll need more than one.\",\n",

This motion sensor product is a great item to thwart those pesky birds from eating my persimmons, cherries, and other fruiting trees.A relative has a motion sensor device to protect koi from predator birds.  Sometimes those little birdies want a fish or fruit meal; however, motion sensor instruments are a tremendous method of eluding their dietary desires.',\n",

I use the two scarecrows to scare critters from our newly created garden pond.  I bought the two scarecrows along with Yard Sentinel's RC Ultrasonic Pest Controller.  They work in unison and are effective!  I have the Yard Sentinel set to only operate after dark for raccoons and any other four-legged critter.  Everything has remained undisturbed.  And, I did not put on the yellow stickers so they are solid black and (to me) less obtrusive.  This was a great investment.\",\n",

       " \"Great Cat Deterrent....Best Price I bought this unit last summer to deter cats from attacking the birds in my back yard.  I have several feeders in my yard, and in the summertime when the bushes and ground cover is heavy, several cats in the neighborhood hide in the brush and very often leap out and nail birds that are ground feeding.  I can't tell you how many times I have gone out there some time during the day to see a pile of feathers on the ground.  Sometimes I am fortunate enough to catch them hiding and I chase them off.  But I can't be back there all the time. Both me and the birds were losing the battle big time for a while. I even resorted once to laying down one of those sprinkler hoses and leaving it on low all the time.  But that was wasteful and expensive...This sprinkler thingy has been a Godsend to me and the birds.  It's so easy to hook up.  You just put a battery in it, attach a hose to it and stick it in the ground.  Its that simple.  I bought two of them for the bushes on each side of my fence and installed a Y connector in the hose so it can deliver water both ways.  It takes a while to get the sensitivity just right, but then its just sit back and watch it patrol the grounds for you.  Since I have had it installed I have not seen the remains of a single victim.  And the burst of water that is left behind is useful to the birds and harmless to the cats. It's true that you have to have a hose running across your yard for it to work, but that is a minor irritation for what you get out of it as far as service for sure.  When I first installed it I saw the area wet all the time as the cats were taking their chances with it.  Now its less and less being used as they have become wise to it and moved on to other game somewhere else.  It's true that the battery doesn't last as long as one would want, but I really don't mind it.  I just change it at the beginning of the month from late spring through September whether it needs it or not and its up and working without interruption.In conclusion, this is one of the cheapest, if not the cheapest form of motion detector sprinkler I have found on Amazon. It installs in a jiffy, works perfectly for me, and seems very well made.  I can't attest to its durability yet, but for the price and performance I highly recommend it.  Great product.. : )\",\n",
       " \"Great Product This product not only works well, but it's also fun to watch!!, especially when rabbits, cats, or dogs come to do their business in your loan or rabbits eating your grass, this thing blast them with a burst of water before they can escape!! I love watching this in the early moring hours. Also when a dog or cat wants to take a poop in your yard and the owner of the pet just lets them do it with cleaning up behind them, this thing will blast the animal with water and they will run away from you property. Have fun watching!!\",\n",
       " 'Not tonight, deer! This is the ONE thing that actually kept the deer out of our garden all last Summer.  All of the various repellents, sprays, dangly-things, and even electric fencing, only held Bambi and Bambi\\'s mother off for a week at best, then they would either get used to them or (in the case of fences) just jump over them.They can\\'t seem to get used to this Scarecrow though - I guess it\\'s just too unpredictable for them.  It held them off all season and I actually got veggies from my garden, whereas my neighbors got nothing but deer-droppings.So I\\'m here to order another this year, to protect my flower garden as well.  (I\\'m also considering using one to ward off pumpkin-stealing pranksters at Hallowe\\'en - that ought to be a good \"treat\"!)  Oh, yah- that reminds me:  don\\'t set this device up where the mailman has to cross its path.  Mail carriers can get a little grumpy about being squirted with water out of the blue - go figure... :)--- Just editing this a year later to add: Not only is it still working (imagine that: getting an electronic product out of the potting shed after winter is over, putting in new batteries, and it STILL WORKS!) but the deer are also still completely put off by it.  Can\\'t ask for better than that!',\n",
       " \"Skeptical but actually works I tried everything for my vegetable garden including fencing, electric fencing, solar vibration but this is the only product that actually worked.  I have deer, chipmunk, turkey, and the most annoying, ground hogs.  This works for all of them.  Just set the sensitivity to the right setting.  Don't jack up the setting too high, otherwise, it'll go off a lot.  Not sure why other reviews say the battery runs out fast which I was worried about but I've had it going for about a month with the product going off several times a day without any issues with the battery.  Perhaps they jacked up the sensitivity to the top.  The only downside is based on the size or layout, you may need to get several of these to keep out the animals.  I have a garden about 50 x 20 with 2 tiers and tall plants so I needed at least 4 to get a good coverage.  Amazon has the best price so get what you need for your garden and keep those pesky animals away!\",\n",

I placed it facing the parts of the yard where the deer trails end.  Heard it go off during the night a few times during the first week, followed by the sound of snorting and stamping deer.  For the first time in years my yard is not a deer buffet--as a matter of fact NOTHING in my yard has been browsed this year.  So glad to finally see some perennials that I haven't seen in five years.  I have tried all kinds of things in the past to deter them and nothing works.  If you have deer problems I highly recommend giving this a try.  If only there was something for winter (besides deer netting).\",\n",
       " \"KIDS LOVE THIS THING!!  5 Star Kids Toy!! I was having a problem with a groundhog that was loving some of my cabbage plants to death (literally). He ate three to complete stumps in two days and was working on his next one when I got this in the mail.I anxiously set it up and learned much about it in the process. I see most of the people here praising it for getting rid of deer, and it may work well for that because they are large targets. It also does disturb smaller varmints but not in the way I expected.Thie product is very difficult to review because while it works somewhat,  a 60 dollar product is not necessary for smaller, less intelligent and less numerous pests.  It is probably great for an area infested with pests though, hundreds of deer or tons of groundhogs, but something much simpler could be used in your average garden setting.The idea of the product is cute and simple enough. It is a motion sensor attached to a sprinkler. If the Scarecrow sees anything that moves, it fires the sprinkler off for about five seconds. It then waits 8 seconds and repeats.The problem is that with smaller varmints, they can hide behind the plants, and when the Scarecrow is aimed low, every plant movement (breeze blowing a cucumber leaf) sets it off unless you turn the sensitivity down so far that it won't go even off with you dancing in front of it.When set to scare away smaller pests, this device falses constantly on plant movement and only sees the varmints if they are totally exposed in front of it, which rarely happens in my garden jungle. The motion sensor concept doesn't work well because everything moves in the garden including the plants. It has a false detector that suppoesdly automatically shuts down the sensitivity if it is falsing too much. It doesn't work well. We have watched the Scarecrow go off every 10 seconds for an hour non-stop with nothing in front of it but plants moving in a very light breeze.The good thing, and the dichotomy for me, is it appeared to get rid of the pest. We have not seen the groundhog since and my few cabbages left are doing OK. So for that, I wanted to give it a much better rating than I otherwise would. The sprinkler does appear to scare away most animals, but it cost me $60 to save $10 worth of cabbage.Cats, dogs, groundhogs, squirrels, rabbits, etc. appear to be driven away by it. And the battery has lasted several weeks. I just can't give it anything but one star because it doesn't work the way it claims and is very expensive for the average Joe. The device works more like a random sprinkler shooting water at random time intervals depending on the breeze.A better product, and one that is actually affordable, would be one you set up that randomly fires a sprinkler every few minutes.  It would be much cheaper and just as effective.  You may be able to recreate it with a timing device that runs on a battery and a $7.00 sprinkler, or just a generic timed sprinkler you use when you notice a pest is bugging your plants. But if you have tons of deer, then this may be your only viable solution short of a major fence or wall.There is another reason the product is very annoying. You have to have it hooked up to the hose all the time. I have to have a hose reeled out across my lawn at all times to reach the garden from the water faucet on my house. It is in the way much of the time, so has to be moved about all the time for family gatherings, lawn mowing, kids want to play in yard etc. But I did discover an alternate use!! Kids love running in front of the Scarecrow. :-) OK, now would you pay $60 to entertain your kids?  OK, so sell it as that.  Much more useful for that purpose.If marketed as a garden tool, the motion sensor should possibly be a heat sensor or something that can discern better between mammalian presence and a leaf in the wind. The sprinkler is little more than a cheap lawn sprinkler attachment. I am very torn in my rating because here is a device that basically did what I wanted it to do, scared away a varmint eating my plants. It has a major cool factor and is a fun conversation piece loved by the kids. But it falses constantly and is difficult to deal with unless you want to run an underground hose to it and it is expensive.I am giving it one star because it works, kind of, but it is not what it advertises itself to be.  A motion sensor cannot work in a dense garden for small animals.BUT YOUR KIDS WILL LOVE IT!  This would get 5 stars as a kids' toy!!  So maybe as a combinational use product it gets more stars?\",\n",

I'm happy to report this has almost completely solved our problem. We have been keeping the sprinkler pointed towards the section we are repairing and the clovers are coming in undisturbed. However, there are blind spots as the sprinler cannot see off to the sides very well. Now the rabbits are hanging around the other half of our yard. Solution- we will definately be getting another one of these for the other half. One annoying thing about the Scarecrow is they didnt include a ring to were you attach the hose to make attaching and unscrewing easier; you have to twist the entire sprinkler around making lining up the threads kind of a pain.

(Minus one star, since most people will not have thread tape.)The next problem was that the water shoots too high in the air. I wanted to aim it at the base of some bird feeders which a raccoon raids every night (climbing over the raccoon baffle), but it was going over the entire feeder from about 10' away. (Minus one star.)Next, I tried moving it to a flower bed where an armadillo often digs, but even putting it on the downhill edge of the bed and slanting it down as much as I could while still being able to get the stake into the ground, the spray was still too high and WAY too long. (Minus one star for not being able to scale down the spray distance to below 15'.)On the positive side, the device uses an infrared sensor, meaning that it keys on moving heat, so that branches blowing in the wind should not set it off. (Add back one star, since the cheapy alternative would have been a simple motion detector.)I'm hoping that having the spray go over the armadillo's head, plus the noise, will be enough to scare him off, but I would have preferred to have it actually hit him with a direct blast of water.\",\n",

I found it fairly easy to change the spool wire on this product.  I recommend buying the trimmer bundle that comes with extra wire and spool.Over all, this was a good product and served its purpose and the price was right. My husband loved it.',\n",

But that said it does exactly what I need it for, to trim edges where my mower can\\'t reach. It is not really too short for me, and I can swing it like a one-handed scythe because it is so light.I was totally disgusted with my much more expensive Makita that would never feed the line properly, so I feel the Black and Decker is worth $19.95 for every time I don\\'t need to swear and pull the Makita reel apart to rewind it!Four years later ----- it\\'s still working! The motor seems to slow down now and then, and the blade that cuts the extended line got loose and then lost, but it still trims just as I need it to do. I got a second unit for the US place last year and it has a better designed handle and faster spinning motor. The \"bump\" line feed in the old one still works most of the time, and I fixed the blade problem by cementing a box cutter blade on the housing. The spool is easily rewound with standard line. No real complaints!',\n",

       " \"Satisfying solution to annoying bugs After an outbreak of pantry moths I was ready to scream.  I tried lots of solutions but none as satisfying as this gadget.  The little devils are hard to kill.  One will all of a sudden appear, fluttering across the room, and if you're not quick, it will disappear again just as fast.  Sometimes you can clap your hands over it to kill it and I've even used a butterfly net, but you can't swat them like you would a fly because when they land they're pretty much invisible.  You have to get them in the air.  I was willing to try any harebrained thing--which I thought this was--but voila!  It zaps the little suckers very effectively.Since you have to grab it fast and have it right way up in order to depress both the buttons to activate it, I put a sign on the 'up' side since it is otherwise not easy to tell.  Once in hand of course, it can be used repeatedly and quickly and is great when sitting out on the deck.  It has made summer evenings much more pleasant.  I really don't want a big zapping machine making noise so this really fills the bill for me.  I've used it a lot in the last year but haven't had to change the batteries yet.When my adult daughter was sitting on the deck one night and came in looking for the bug spray, I gave her this gadget.  She was super impressed and bought one herself.If you hit a damp object or a big bug, there is a rather loud spark and sizzle so you have to be prepared to deal with that, but it absolutely works.\",\n",

Anyhow i got away cheaply with this one i guess for once! The bigger bugs are definitely much \"funner\" to watch because there is more action once they hit the racket but nothing gets away from this thing.This thing could even been used to blow off steam after a bad day just switch the light on at night and go outside and go at it like there is no tomorrow! The bugs are not going to stop coming as long as the light is on and you will definitely get a workout with all the swinging...;)I\\'ve ordered plenty more gifts and just to have in the house for when people come over and want one because this is definitely going to be the summer accessory find for this year!BUY ONE AND HAVE FUN!!!',\n",
       " 'Surprisingly Useful This item and similar products are usually marketed as novelties, but I have found mine to be an indispensable tool.  That\\'s because your basic flyswatter is incomplete since it requires a nearby flat \"killing surface\" to get the job done; if the flying bug in question refuses to cooperate by landing on or flying slowly near such a killing surface, a flyswatter is useless.On the other hand this tool can take care of insect pests flying in the middle of the room, next to things that cannot safely be swatted, or outdoors.  This particular model has a couple of buttons that must be pressed and held down simultaneously (by thumb and forefinger) in order to charge, which happens almost instantaneously, and a red LED to let you know it is ready, all of which contribute to extending battery life.  Despite my son\\'s bug hunting safaris, I\\'m still on my first set of two AA batteries.  Use is basically the opposite of a flyswatter: move it slowly until the grid touches the insect pest (there will usually be a visible flash).  Cleanup in most cases involves wiping with a tissue.Obviously, the larger the bug, the less likely you will kill it outright with the first charge, but at the very least this thing will knock it to the ground.  I would not advise seeking out combat with a swarm of hornets, but this tool would be about the only effective response in addition to running for cover.  Which product you choose is up to you; my buying decision was made for me by a combination of sale, coupon, and discount that reduced the cost of this item to zero.',\n",

If you swat a fly out of the air it will usually just injure it and you will find it bouncing around on the floor.  It's actually pretty easy to trap them under the swatter by just lowering it down over the fly, kills em pretty quickly this way.  You'd think they'd sense it quicker and move but maybe the wire netting allows the air flow through enough that they're not alerted.  Anyway, it's fun to see the little spark when you get them.  We've kept one in the kitchen and going to buy one for the RV now.  Don't let the kids play with this, it's actually a pretty strong zap.  It is fun, however, to play with it yourself and zap the kids!  And zap the friends and the spouse.  Yeah, everyone loves it! ;)Oh yeah, the case is nice too.

Apparently that is the best way to get mosquitoes, according to these folks (who should be VERY familiar with mosquitoes and their ways!)

I change the batteries maybe once a year, and I rate this as one of my best purchases ever.  My husband likes it too because with this racket I can tackle the spiders in our house on my own.  Very happy, especially considering the inexpensive price.**Original review**I live on a couple acres in the woods, complete with creek.  My targets include gnats, mosquitoes, flies, moths, spiders, and perhaps the occasional wasp.  Gnats are vaporized, moths give a gratifying spark and perhaps a wisp of smoke when they hit the racket, and dead mosquitoes get stuck to the racket but are easily shaken off.A few nights ago, a big housefly got inside our home and I grabbed the racket to take care of him.  He flew into the racket as I held it over him near the window and zapped him easily.  This morning, I accidently let in a huge moth that promptly headed for the nearest lamp.  I carefully stuck the racket under the lampshade, and the moth flew right into it.  I can\\'t imagine how difficult it would have been otherwise to get rid of that fly and moth without the racket.I love this racket for taking care of spiders too!The only negative I\\'ve noticed is that when I\\'m wildly swinging this zapper around to see how many gnats I can kill, the battery cover slides a little.  Not a big deal to me.  If I\\'m not swinging it wildly, the battery cover doesn\\'t budge.I picked this bug zapper over the other oh-so-similar racket zappers available because this one only has horizontal zapper wires in the racket area..... no protective mesh that might interfere with eliminating pesky bugs.**Update** August 2009: I\\'ve owned this racket for over 18 months now with frequent use, and someone requested a specific update about a couple of common problems with this racket, so here it is!  Regarding having to press on two buttons to use this racket, I\\'m glad of this feature because it reduces the likelihood of it bumping up against something in storage and accidentally being turned on.  The buttons are staggered on each side of the handle so that my thumb is on the upper button, and my index finger is on the lower button.  I have to take 1/2 a second to make sure my fingers are in the right place and the little LED light is on and working, but it doesn\\'t bother me.  The buttons are a safety feature and I\\'m willing to work with them.  Regarding the battery cover, it sometimes slides about 1/2\", but it has never slid off completely so I don\\'t worry about it.  I\\'m STILL on the original set of batteries this zapper came with.  :)  If this racket zapper ever stops working perfectly, I\\'ll update, but so far it really has exceeded expectations.',\n",

It wont kill a person, but it does hurt, which is a strong indication of its effectiveness against the much, much smaller insects.

       " \"The Old Reliable One Ringer Compost Plus is an excellent supplement to kick start a compost pile. It works with either an open pile or compost apparatus.Composting is not terribly complicated, get the right nutrients (yard waste), the right amount of water, the right temperature, the right amount of air, and the right bacteria; and that yard waste will decompose to something wonderful for your garden. The scary part with composting, if a few of those elements are off, the compost pile ends up smelling really bad. This ringer product helps get the bacteria side of the equation working right. You still have to water the pile during dry periods, aerate the pile, and add material to the top. It isn't a magic wand that takes the every other day tending out of the equation.The bacteria that decompose yard waste are already present in those leaves, grass clippings, and wood chips. It is just at a very low level. Ringer Compost Plus boosts the bacteria count quickly and gets the compost pile working much faster than if left to its own devices. In theory, applying this once should do the job, just like sourdough bread. In practice, I end up getting lazy with my compost pile and let things run crazy. Ringer's bacteria are also chosen to work at higher temperatures, meaning the compost pile will decompose quicker.Ringer's yard products are amazing. I've used their Lawn Restore fertilizer for a long time. Unlike synthetic fertilizers with really high nitrogen and phosphorus levels, this is a gentle fertilizer. I'd have to work hard to get my lawn to stripe or look uneven from this fertilizer. There is also a blend of bacteria in the fertilizer that makes my lawn a lot healthier. The product is organic, but that's not why I buy it. It just makes my lawn look great in a gentle way. Their Compost Plus hasn't changed a lot over the years either. It is the old reliable product it always was. Ringer products are not easy to find - the fertilizer is very expensive to order on line. Safer Brand is the main company. I've seen their products in Do It Better and Ace Hardware stores. I haven't seen it in the big box home repair centers.Compost Plus is a great way to get that compost pile working.\",\n",

You have to be patient, too!We are diligent about our composting:  We have 1 1/2 acres of manicured lawn, many gardens, many trees and bushes and a free-range chicken yard.  So we need a lot of compost and we generate a lot of compost material.  We use a double-barrel Mantis for our composting:  It makes the turning and churning a breeze.  But we really need to make a lot of compost to capitalize on the Mantis investment.Even with all the great compost material we generate, we still need an accelerator every once in a while--especially during colder months. And then sometimes our mix of \"green\" and \"brown\" material is not quite right.  Sometimes we just want compost fast--well, at least faster than its normal slow-but-sure progress.  We always have a box of this stuff on hand.Just an extra thought that may prompt someone to get into composting:  Even with our Mantis compost-maker, we still have compost makin\\'s left over.  So we bought a roll of plastic fencing and made a triangle using the fencing on the inside corner of a chain link fence.  We dump our grass clippings and leaves into this simply-made 8\\'x8\\'x8\\' triangle.  When we first dumped a partial box of this Ringer compost-maker onto our 5\\' tall pile, it fell 1 1/2\\' within a week.  So, do not doubt that it works.

The thing that convinced me to try this produce was that it is a 100% natural product and, as much as possible, I like to keep an organic garden. As an aside, I read Mike McGroatry\\'s blog/website a lotEasy Plant Propagationand agree with him that compost isn\\'t complicated--it\\'s what nature wants to do with a pile of clippings. The best thing you can do is just get out of the way and let nature take her course. But you have to be patient (not one of my more stellar qualities).The problem I\\'ve had is that while I do get great compost/soil from the pile over the course of a summer, it\\'s a slow process. With that in mind I decided to try this product. (I also thought of buying one of those tumbling things, but have you seen how much they cost?)I tried the product today. The instructions call for sprinkling about a cup on a pile that\\'s about 3 x 4\\' and about 12\" deep. I had a freshly stacked pile of materials (both green and brown materials) that was about that size and 3\\' tall already, so what I did was spread it out and and then re-piled it but added a cup of the Compost Plus for every 12\" depth or so. I watered each layer (as per instructions) as I re-stacked the composting materials and built the pile back up to its original height. This sounds complicated, but it took all of 10 minutes. I just used a pitchfork and it was very easy work.I won\\'t know for a month or so if this is any faster, but I\\'m hoping to see some evidence (heat perhaps) that this stuff is speeding up the process. I may even be able to tell sooner than that. One thing I got from the packaging was that it\\'s important to have a good level of moisture in your compost pile--not too wet, but certainly not dry. I have been remiss in that--again, I just let the rain water it normally. I will try to be more careful about keeping this pile wet to give the product a fair chance. If it works and speeds up the process, I\\'ll be thrilled. I\\'m reading a lot lately about the value of microorganisms in soil (and reading a lot about no till gardening)Plowman\\'s Follyand that is what this product is: a mix of select microorganisms.I will update this review in a few weeks and report back on how its working.

It\\'s definitely doing something to the stuff I\\'ve been adding to the pile--coffee grinds, egg shells, fruit peels, veggie trimmings, dead plants, leaves, etc.The thing is, I don\\'t know how much this compost additive is responsible, if at all, for the results. I think I probably would have had a pretty ripe compost pile anyway, but I just don\\'t know. What I will say, though, is that I don\\'t see any mold or mildew or anything else that would prevent me from continuing to compost.One thing I will suggest if you\\'re new to composting, as I was just a few weeks ago, is that when you start your pile, you need to start with some variety in terms of size and waste. However, make sure you don\\'t leave anything that\\'s too big. I started with the branches I trimmed from my rose bushes. I should have probably cut everything down to no larger than 6 or 8 inches long, but I\\'ve got a few branches that are over a foot, and I don\\'t know if it\\'s because of the number of branches (they started out as about half my pile) or the size of the branches, but they are very difficult to turn with the other stuff I\\'ve got in the compost box. I thought about cutting them down, but given the effectiveness of the heat and sun (and the Ringer), I\\'m not willing to touch it with my hands (gloved or not).I know I\\'ve got a ways to go before the compost pile will be ready to apply to the rose bushes or the fledgling garden, but I\\'m looking forward to doing an update then.',\n",

Since I\\'ve been doing a bit more gardening, I thought a more active, rapid compost would be nice, so I tried the Ringer.  I\\'ve followed the directions, kept the pile moist, turned it a bit.  I can\\'t tell much difference, though honestly, I never really looked too closely at the pile before.  It may be decomposing faster, but it isn\\'t a warm pile like I sort of expected.

If it is really cold outside you will have to be more careful to have your ingredients shredded and in the proper carbon to nitrogen ratio. Otherwise this starter will work well if you have more brown than green. In the summer when I am composting mostly greens, then this starter is pretty much unnecessary.

The compost that results helps the garden (and increases the worms).  My problem has been that composting is slow.  This Ringer Compost Plus  helps speed the process, so I can build soil that will nourish my plants.I have not measured the temperature in my composter, but in spite of the fact that our weather has been much cooler than normal, the material I put in the composter a month ago has been turning into soil quite nicely.  Ringer says to expect composting to complete in 60 to 90 days, but I'm seeing results much sooner than that.  I'm ready to turn out my first batch of the year tomorrow.In addition to working quickly, this product is a bargain, costing about half of the compost starter I had been using.If you have an interest in improving your soil and putting the scraps from kitchen and yard to good use, try this.

I've not had very dramatic results composting in the bin by itself - it just seems to not decompose very quickly, despite following the general directions for this process.  So I thought perhaps this additive would speed things up.When I first received the Ringer product, I sprinkled a good cup or two into the compost pile as is.  It was going to rain the next day, so I didn't water it in.  I have noticed so far that the pile seems to have sunk more than what I'm used to seeing.This Ringer stuff smells like a barn, uh, natural fertilizer if you will.  While the cardboard box helps reduce the odor somewhat, I decided to store this in a tightly lidded plastic container, so that I could keep this under my sink without the sink cabinet beginning to smell.I keep a small bucket on my counter for compostible fruit/veggie pieces.  I have started adding a small scoop of the Ringer product to my bucket before I take it outside to the compost pile.

I do not think it made a difference at all.

       " \"Composting I have been composting for almost 25 years. We produce a lot of kitchen waste as well as garden waste, and have a yard full of leaves. My father composted long before it was popular. He started about 45 years ago and I learned from him. In order to compost well you must have oxygen, moisture, organic matter and the bacteria to break down the waste.Just as happens in any wooded area, all of these elements are present and occur in good time naturally. If you wish to speed up the process; it requires some work and the addition of micro-organisms. This is where the Ringer Compost Plus comes into the picture. Here is where the micro-organisms come from.Am I sure this product has all of the right organisms for my waste, how can one tell? Only time will be the judge. In from one to three months I can add to this review. I would add.... why would Ringer sell a product that will not work, since it is a product which is generally re-bought if it works well.Also,organic gardeners do compare notes.It is important to also make sure your compost gets the other things it needs. A rolling barrel can be purchased or just turn the compost pile periodically with a shovel and keep it moist. I do not like shovel work and I am cheap, so I made a composting unit out an old water well pressure tank that had failed. I mounted it sideways  on a simple 2x4 frame. It's about the size of an oil drum. I cut a door with a reciprocating saw, hinged it and added a latch. I added a shaft through the center that sticks out of the ends and they sit on the wood frame, (Like a hamster wheel). I can spin it to mix the compost which adds air and moisture through out. Maybe in 90 days I can give Compost Plus 5 stars.\",\n",

It is a wonderful way to get rid of all the food scraps and peelings that you usually through in the garbage.There is more to composting than just putting scrapes on the ground you can actually use vacuum bag dust (if there is no food) I also put my hair cuttings, newspapers and leaves and grass clippings are also used. Letters and junk mail can be cut up and tossed in also.  All  you have to do is toss all of this once in a while and you come up with compost.  I am lazy I never turn my compost I leave it out and my chickens have a ball scratching up the compost.  I wind up having the best soil for the summer garden.Ringer 3050 Compost Plus is a great product it has lots of good micro organisms that literally eat up all the waste and turn it into compost.  Sure you can get a good soil without it but this product speeds up the porcess and adds lots of good organisms that add extra nutrishment to the mix.All you do is lay down the foundation and then add the amount  you need for the size pile you have, turn it a few times wet it down and within 3 months you start to see the results of the composting.  You can use the fresh soil for anything to grow, plants vegetables, flowers shrubs and even sprinkle it on the grass..',\n",
       " \"amazingly effective, safe and easy to use I've used this saw for several hours which is sufficient to give me an opinion as to its effectiveness and value. It's easy to set up, just use the wingnut clamp to secure it to the pole and off you go, no tools required. It stays put as does the extention of the pole. One easy to use clip on the pole allows you to move the extention in or out and lock it. It stays locked. Use it off the pole to trim off limbs from felled trees or easy to reach stuff. I've found many uses for the saw without the pole that makes to yard work go easy. It's safer than a gas chain saw and lighter. It is durable, it hasn't failed me. I maintain my machines and keep them ready to work, but I don't baby this saw or any piece of machinery. This saw does what it's supposed to without complaint. I pinched the chain in a limb (operator error!) and had to free it with another saw, but the Remington went right back to working without throwing a chain, bending, or breaking. Anyway you ...slice... it, using a chain saw to cut trees is tough on machinery. This saw has chewed through pine, oak, and cherry quickly and easily. When it's at full extention it's a little unwieldy because, afterall, you have a weight on one end of a pole and it will tend to be top heavy. But it is light enough to manuver and keep where you want it to cut and I haven't found its balance to be a problem. It does leak chain oil. In the yard, who cares? In the garage, it can be messy. But also tells you in the manual that it will leak the chain oil and recommends that you empty the oil resevoir when you store the saw. It holds about 3 ounces of motor oil and draining the oil is a ten second operation. Not a problem. When in use, one push of the oiler cap before eash cut and it's happy. It has an aggressive chain tooth layout which helps to slice through even big limbs. It's a ten inch saw, if you need to cut 14+ inch limbs/trees, you'll need a heavier chainsaw that's designed for that purpose. If you use this saw for its designed use, you won't have any difficulty pruning or taking off fairly meaty limbs from a safe position. I recommend it.\",\n",

I would highly recommend this product for anyone interested in a chain saw on a pole.Keys to keeping this working well is keep the chain oiled.

Home Depot sells replacement chains...CONS.1. Balance is an issue. It gets pretty heavy balancing an electric saw on a long pole..2. Poor design causes wood debris to quickly accumulate in the gear area. As a result, wood chips need to be removed between uses. Failure to do this will cause the chain to slip off or damage the nylon sprocket that moves the chain..3. Chain guide bends when the chain is tightened. As a result, an accurate cut is almost impossible..4. The tightening screw comes off very easily due to vibration during usage. After losing it, the only way to tighten the chain is to unscrew the two bolts holding the metal chain guide, move it forward, and retighten the two bolts with one hand while maintaining pressure on the other..5. The unit is underpowered. Eight amps is not enough for cutting large branches..6. It is very cheaply made. For example, the chain guide is thin. As a result, it bends to the side. Second, the gears and sprocket are made of plastic or nylon and will wear away in short time. Third, the oil reserve is a small squeeze bottle that is useless. It does not hold enough oil and needs constant refills.',\n",

Trimming that limb over your fence, no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.

The problem was that while the machine does catch mosquitoes, it does not catch enough of them to make a serious dent in the overall population.  It was not until I sprayed the yard with Cutter Bug-Free BackyardCutter Bug Free Backyard 32 oz Ready-to-Spray Hose End Insect Repellent Concentrate HG-61067, that I finally got rid of the mosquitoes.I did not like this product for many reasons:  it had a high initial cost, it required replacing the Octenol attractant (more $$), and the propane tank needed refilling about every 3-4 weeks (more $$).  In addition, it needs an electrical cord plug-in nearby, and one has to replace the mosquito catch nets (more $$).  Basically, it costs too much to operate, takes too much on-going maintenence time and effort, and most importantly, it did not eliminate the pesky mosquitoes!  So now I have two of these things taking up space in my shed.  I will not sell the devices because they simply do not work to control mosquitoes.

Being an avid sewer, I am quite familiar with Fiskars scissors and have many pairs that I rely on and have for many, many years.

Great for those jobs where I used to use small hand pruners that took lots & lots of effort (you know those branches that are really too big for hand pruners, but that you don't want to get the big giant loppers out for, so you squeeze & squeeze the pruners until the branch is finally cut??)  These cut SO easily & cleanly that they're a pleasure to use.(As an aside, I had an old pair of Fiskars hand pruners that had become badly misaligned.  I called the company to inquire about how I could fix them, and they just replaced them for me.  Great customer service!)These loppers are really for relatively close branches; should you need to prune branches that are farther away, you'd want to buy longer ones.Highly recommended.\",\n",

I want anyone shopping for garden tools to know that this is a great company that stands behind its products even when their customers fail to use them properly.

       " 'The absolute best cutter I bought this tool because of the reviews. The reviews were so correct. This tool is a great investment. You will be inspired to clean up neglected shrubs etc. on your property. If the branch fits into the opening, you can get a good clean cut. You have to get used to the cutting angle, but after a short time, you become a pro. Great tool!',\n",
       " 'has some limitations, but this Fiskars lopper works very well overall... The Fiskars 9625 PowerGear Bypass Lopper is a very effective tool, that usually gets the job done, without the user having to expend an excessive amount of energy.  This is mostly because the lopper is designed with some large \"gearlike\" teeth, which act to increase leverage, and direct the applied force to the cutting surfaces.  This results in a tool that is generally more efficient and requires less effort, than most conventionally designed cutters, where brute force is usually required to cut through thicker or harder objects.According to the information on the product page, the maximum capacity is a diameter of 1.5 inches.  So far, I have used the PowerGear only on shrubs and small trees, with branches that are about an inch or less in diameter.  It has no problems cutting through either softer branches, or harder dried out ones.  Because the lower cutting edge is curved, you can\\'t always go straight in, and cut where you want.  You may need to alter your approach, and come in at an alternate angle, in order to make the cut.  This can be slightly inconvenient, but you will learn to work around it.If you are used to applying massive force when using a cutter, you may be pleasantly surprised by the PowerGear, as it usually makes the task easier, and seldom becomes a physical struggle.  The blades are supposedly coated with a non-stick substance.  I\\'m not sure how long this lasts, but so far the blades have been relatively easy to clean.The blades are described as being \"razor sharp\" and \"precision ground\", but that\\'s mostly promotional hype.  The blade is certainly sharp, but I was slightly disappointed at the uneven cutting edge on my blade.  The feel of the plastic handles is just adequate, as they don\\'t provide an especially secure grip, something that can be important, when you are wearing work gloves, which can be slippery.A particularly strange oddity concerns the color of the blade.  My blade is black, but in some photos the blade is sliver colored.  I have no idea, what difference this may make, but the lack of standardization just seems strange.There are several versions of the PowerGear lopper, so you may want to check for the one that best suits your needs.  This one is for mid-sized branches, that are within easy reach.  Usually priced at about $25, I had to wait for some time before I was able to buy this cutter for just $18.  If you see it at that level, you might want to act fast, as it probably won\\'t be there for long.  Like most Fiskars products, this one is fairly well designed and a solid value.',\n",
       " 'Cuts \"three times easier\" These are designed to cut far more easily than your garden variety loppers, and they do just that. It says right on the handles that they cut \"three times easier,\" and indeed they do. You want a tool that does the same amount of work with 1/3 the force on the handle side. Since work equals force times displacement, you need to triple the displacement of (amount you open) the handles, and you will get the same amount of work done with 1/3 the amount of force. Since the blade is moving effectively 1/3 the distance you\\'d expect for such a large movement of the handles, it\\'s providing three times the force, allowing you to do what really amounts to the same amount of work, but with what feels like 1/3 the effort.Since the blade, when closed, looks to be at somewhere near a 30 degree angle compared to the handle, and when opened, appears to be at around a 90 degree angle, the gears are accomplishing exactly what is needed to do what they claim. It\\'s not a marketing claim. It\\'s not a matter of what it feels like subjectively. When they say that it cuts three times more easily, it\\'s an objective fact.The only possible down side is that if you need to work close and have limited room for handle movement, the blades won\\'t separate enough. But for pruning trees, that\\'s probably a non issue. They claim that it will cut branches up to 1.5 inches, and I concluded the same thing when I used them. But it will take the amount of force needed with other tools to cut a 1/2 inch branch. When I cut the largest branch I needed to cut using the maximum opening of the jaws (perhaps a bit more than 1.5 inches) it did take effort (but not struggle) to close the handles. But on branches of an inch or less, I\\'ve had more problems cutting paper with school scissors.',\n",

It blends in well, and holds a heavy pot securely. It is not permanent - I had no problems removing it and repositioning it (after removing the pot, of course).On the downside, the construction quality for something that is going to be outdoors 100% of the time (and often wet from rain or water coming out of the pot) is not as good as I would have liked it to be. It's all steel (painted) held together with welds. My concern is rust - it would have been nice to have it be made of stainless, or have a plastic coating on the steel to help prevent/minimize rust. I'll certainly be bringing this indoors in the winter, and most likely will need to spray paint it regularly to keep it rust-free, especially where it may get scratched from a clay pot.But so far so good.

I ended up buying two of them in the same 10 inch size top add more pots to our front deck and they were just as easy to install and work just as well.

The metal, while strong, when supporting a wide-based pot, seems like it's taxing its available strength to hold the bot up.  Also, depending on the pot, the side rails may be too high or, in my case, far to low to hold a tall pot in a way that looks and feel secure.

There are three bolts and nuts to hold it together.The problem started for me on the install. My prefab (plastic) railings are just a hair too wide to use the short side of the L bracket so if I use the long side of the bracket it sticks out into the basket area by inches. Which means that any flower pot put inside is then hindered by the brackets taking up some of the valuable area to place your pot. I also had trouble trying to tighten the nuts to keep it together since they are underneath the bracket arm. You have to tighten them and then put it back on the railing.There is a part that rests against your banister to keep the basket in a level position.It's nice but not great.

Since it can be adjusted fairly tightly on the ledge, it won't fall down, and the plant will not accidentally topple over the way it would if I just placed it on the balcony ledge without a pot holder. Staggering the plant pot heights from high to low allows each plant to have an individual focal point, and the pot holder sits up the highest on the ledge so that's great.The holder is easy to adjust with a variety of three holes per side and screws to secure it.  However, my balcony ledge is a little wide so I can only use one screw per side.  That isn't really a problem since my pot is balanced correctly thanks to the pot's non-tip bumper in the back bottom of the holder.  Also I like the fact that the holder is light weight and black is preferable, though it also comes in white. In addition, it is easy to move around or change the position of the pot and readjust the screws.

That seems like a good idea, except the bottom of the frame is an non-camferred slot- so the screws stick out.  The nuts on top are plastic acorn nuts that don\\'t have a metal inside.  This makes them easy to cross thread, easy to over tighten and generally, difficult to deal with.  It seems to me that a combination of a carriage bolt (so you didn\\'t have to hold the bottom, it would hold itself) and a better nut could have made this so much easier to deal with.So, maybe what I\\'m saying is that this is a perfectly acceptable hanger- but that its harder to deal with then it should be.',\n",

Right now it's holding my pot of blooming daffodils of my front porch railing. I also like the fact that it's made in the USA.\",\n",

It is best on something like a deck railing as the top of this will be about level with the top of the railing so most what you will see is the plant. It could be used on a fence too but may be a bit too high.',\n",
